         Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
   
   I ask an Oracle of Thelema for this Working.
   
   `Liber Lapidis Lazuli' the Solar chapter: ``white cat, the
   sparks fly from thy fur! Thou dost crackle with splitting
   the worlds.'' I ask a Yi King symbol for the whole Working:
   XX `Big Earth'. It means Manifestation: i.e. the bringing
   forth to birth of the forces hitherto developed by us in
   secret.
   
   I ask a Tarot Trump to represent the Prime Pantacle of the
   Operation: XVI The House of God.
   
   Now the Oath of the Working is to establish The Book of the
   Law; in particular to finish the Comment and to publish the
   book as therein commanded. First therefore in this Work is
   Hermes to be invoked and next the Sun. I am therefore to
   restore the Card `The House of God' as I did when I abode in
   the body of Alphonse Louis Constant with the Card `The
   Devil'. I will therefore obtain a Vision of this Card, and
   paint it upon a panel of mahogany wood, with the proper
   colours and forms.
   
   Now on the day of the Sun, in this the Sixteenth Year of the
   Aeon, when He stood in the 6th Degree of the Sign
   Sagittarius, whose letter hath the value of 60, the Moon
   being in the 16th Degree of the Sign Cancer whose letter
   hath the value 8, did the Beast 666 TO Mega Therion a Magus
   of A.'. A.'. Baphomet 729 the Supreme Holy King of Ireland,
   Iona and all the Britains that are in the Sanctuary of the
   Gnosis Xth degree O.T.O., Avatar of Bacchus Diphues in the
   Place of the XIth degree O.T.O., Logos of the Aeon of Ra
   Hoor Khuit, Grand Master of the Knights of the Holy Ghost,
   Grand Master of the Knights of the Temple, Eidolon of the
   Rosy Cross, Alastor the Destroyer Spirit of Solitude,
   Wanderer of the Waste, of the Blood of Kerval Arch-Druids
   Hereditary to the Oak, whose Holy Angel his Guardian is
   Aiwaz 93, the God first dawning upon Man in the Land of
   Sumer, whose breast beareth the token adventure upon
   Mountains beyond any man of his fellows, whose body and
   blood bear witness of the wounds of Astarte, and the shames
   of Priapus, even I in the Abbey of Thelema at Cephaloedium
   that am hidden, did convene therein to counsel Alostrael,
   31-666-31, the Scarlet Woman Lea my concubine, in whom is
   all power given, sworn unto Aiwaz, prostituted in every part
   of her body to Pan and to the Beast, mother of Bastards,
   aborter, whore to herself, to man, woman, child and brute,
   partaker of the Eucharist of the Excrements in the Mass of
   the Devil, Sorceress of the Rite of Esau and Jacob, and also
   GENESTHAI, 143,{WEH NOTE: C.F.Russell} a Neophyte of
   A.'.A.'., a Master Magician of O.T.O. and a Passed Postulant
   to the Secret Chamber of the Knights of the Temple, High
   Priest unto the Beast before the Altar of Purple and Gold.
   
   First then this Brother GENESTHAI made of Invocation of
   Tahuti Lord of Wisdom in the Great Magical Circle of the
   Abbey, that He might come upon us in power.
   
   Thus was Tahuti manifest in the mind of The Beast, like
   Light therein, clear, icy, wit without heart. And I beheld
   the Working afar off, full utterly of desire towards it; and
   I was aware of certain things concerning it; as here now to
   be writ down.
   
   Firstly: the Working shall establish the Aeon of Ra Hoor
   Khuit by obeying the instructions given in "The Book of the
   Law".
   
   Secondly: it is a Working of Mercury and Sol, combined even
   as they are in the Beast; so that the Word of the Working is
   Aleph-Lamed-Dalet-Yod {WEH NOTE: sic, probably should be
   Aleph-Lamed-Hay}, 36, the square of 6 and the sum of the
   first eight numbers, etc., etc. Now Aleph is the letter of
   Hadith as Hay of Nuith, and Lamed is their balanced union.
   
   Thirdly: Alostrael resumeth Nuit and The Beast Hadith; Their
   Copulation is therefore by this word 36 well signified.
   
   Fourthly: it is written, `Liber Lapidis Lazuli', Cap. III,
   vv. 16-18 that all is vain unless there be ``a man's life
   spilt for thy love upon Mine Altars.'' Thus then let His
   High Priest do sacrifice to The Beast, thereby to consecrate
   Him to the Rite.
   
   Fifthly: that `The Paris Working', the first model for our
   present Orgia, is not to be followed pedantically.
   
   Sixthly and lastly: that special names are to be used by us;
   for The Beast Ophion 700, for Genesthai 143 Iacchaion, and
   for Alostrael a new name not yet given. Also that the vapour
   of the Oxide of Ethyl may be used in the Workings.
   
   After this the "Yi King" gave us our First Working as Air of
   Air [57], that is, these present writings and considerations
   of the Whole Matter.
   
   I now make Qabalistic investigation of the letter Peh.
   
   1. It is `A Mouth' and therefore is the Word therein.
   
   2. Its value 80 is Jesod, the Foundation.
   
   3. It is the Third Letter to Aleph and Lamed in CCXX, and
   the final of Aleph-Lamed-Peh. Cf. also ``eight, eighty, four
   hundred and eighteen'' ``knowing the law of the fortress, &
   the great mystery of the House of God.''
   
   4. It is the third equilibrating Path on the Tree. As
   Stability is only perfect as infinite Change (see XIth
   Aethyr) so Construction is only solid if based on War.
   
   5. ``I am a God of War'' etc. is Ra Hoor Khuit.
   
   6. The Word in the Mouth is 93: Aiwaz is the Lord of the
   Fortress or House of God, which is the Abbey of Thelema.
   
   7. Aiwaz is spelt Ayin, the Eye, i.e. that of Shiva or
   Horus, the Meatus Penis and the Anus; Yod, the Phallus,
   Spermatozoon; and Hand, Vau, the Fertility of the Testes and
   Uterus as well as the Nail of the mentula, being Taurus the
   Cow Isis and the Bull Apis or Shiva, the Son in
   Tetragrammaton, the Redeemer by Reproduction, the Mithraic
   Bull of Resurrection and Initiation in the strength of the
   Body. And lastly Zain is the Sword of the Phallus, and
   Gemini the double sexual nature, the murder-lust between the
   incestuous twins Cain and Abel, Horus and Set or
   Harpocrates, Osiris and Typhon, etc. And Gemini is the airy
   pulse that gives a basis for the Voice of the Messenger, the
   menstruum of the Holy Ghost, the swing of the motion of
   Love, the house of the Sun in May, when he impregnates Maia
   with Mercurius whose mouth uttereth His Father. And Zain
   spelt fully is 67, the number of Binah the All-Mother. Ayin
   is moreover the Devil of Lust, the Goat of Mendes, Pan,
   Baphomet; and spelt fully Ayin is the Erection and Leaping
   and Extension of the Phallus; Yod is the Spermatoon, the
   Solitary Boy Hermes, the Virgin; while Nun is the Eagle of
   sexual Ecstasy, the Serpent of Life through Death, the
   Scorpion or Scarab of Kephra, the Womb which transmutes
   through corruption, the Semen or fluid vehicle of the
   Spirit, the Elixir of Magick, the Blood, Wine, and Poison in
   the Chalice. And Yod repeating that God, and prophesying the
   Vau that follows it, ends with Daleth the letter of Venus,
   the Door of the Palace of Love. Then Vau reproduceth itself
   in its spelling, as it is written ``all is ever as it was''
   in "The Book of the Law", and in Aiwaz are found the Three
   Star-Clusters of Earth-Nature, the Goat under the God Set or
   Saturn for Hadith, the Begetter, and Mars exalted therein
   for Force and Fire, the Virgin under Thoth or Mercury, His
   Word creating in her the Eidolon of His Nature, and the Bull
   under Isis or Venus, the mighty redemption and nourish ment
   of Love, for Nuith the Womb of Space wherein Her Lord
   worketh His Work.
   
   By this cometh forth the Sign of the Child, the Star-Cluster
   of the Twins, under Hermes the Word, airy, elastic,
   bisexual, eternally young, the lovers born of one Womb, made
   Two that by Love they may make themselves One.
   
   So then in this Name Aiwaz is every rite of the Magick of
   the Aeon of Horus declared in detail, and in His number 93
   is shewn forth not only the Word of the Law, but the Ways of
   the Word and the Mysteries of Truth.
   
   This Name then and this Number shall be the Glyph Hieratic
   to unlock the Fortress of the Aeon; Captain is He of all the
   hosts of Mars, and Ra Hoor Khuit crowned King in that Palace
   of Force and Fire. Set, The Beast, for Ayin; Thoth, Alastor
   the Logos, for Yod; Apis, Perdurabo, for Vau; and Hoor
   Hoorpakraat, Baphomet, for Zain; foursquare, mystic,
   wonderful, as cherubs shall I that am One through these Four
   be the builder and warder thereof. And the Scarlet Woman
   shall bear Her Cup therein, bestriding Her Beast: &
   Iacchaiion shall stand with his Rod, to wige That Beast
   therewith.
   
   For he hast the Wand of Death & The Beast the Cup of Death,
   but the Beast hath the Wand of Life & the Scarlet Woman the
   Chalice of Life. Now Pe joineth & guardeth the Victory & the
   Splendor, the frontiers of the Kingdom of Truth: & it is the
   Issue, whereby the Bowmen sally forth from the centre
   Tiphereth to Yesod the apex of the salient. And Pe is the
   girdle of the Loins of the All-Father & the Sword in the
   girdle, as Teth is his breast-plate of courage, & Daleth his
   Helmet of Live. This Sword is shewn as a lightning-Flash of
   Flaming Sword on the Fortress that defends the Kingdom: it
   is the Sword or Spear of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. The card is then
   thus briefly to be described.
   
   Ra Hoor Khuit sends forth a Ray of Light as a Sword. The
   Fortress is his Aeon of 11 towers for abrahadabra. Within is
   Aiwaz with 93 or 220. About it is 666 in four-fold form. The
   Scarlet Woman bears Cup & Sword, riding The Beast: &
   Iacchaion follows with his Rod. Thus far concerning the Card
   XVI.
   
   Now then followeth a consideration of the Vestments of the
   Artists. Of the Robes & Insignia of the Work.
   
   1. The Scarlet Woman shall wear the Scarlet Abbai: for it is
   (a) proper to Her
   (b) proper to Mars
   (c) proper to Aries, wherein the Sun is exalted. She shall
   bear a Golden Cup for Wine, Blood, or Poison; & be girt with
   a Sword, as it is written in the "Book of the Law." She
   shall wear a girdle of white or of mixed colours. In her
   hair she shall wreathe Her Serpent.
   
   2. The Beast shall wear an orange slip & sash as proper to
   (a) Hod
   (b) the Sun
   (c) Gemini: for he is Prophet of the Gods, & he is The Beast
   666, of the Sun, & he is innocent, a Child, even, as
   Horus-Harpocrates, with the double Function in Love. Over
   this shall he wear the Robe of Blue for Nuit lined with
   Scarlet for Hadith & the Sun is gold on his breast. He shall
   wear the Crimson Cap for Binah, that covereth him, with the
   White Cross of John for Kether. He shall wear His ring of a
   magus, & his Rosy Cross. He shall bear the Wand of Obeah,
   with its Janus-head of Man & Woman, & its Four Snakes for
   His weapons.
   
   3. Iacchaion shall wear the Black robe lined with gold, for
   he commeth forth from the darkness of the outer, & the Light
   but fringeth him. also black is proper to a Neophyte. His
   head shall be bare, for shamelessness, & as the symbol of
   his function in this Working. he shall bear the style & the
   papyrus for Thoth, to write the words of the Work. Also he
   shall bear "The Book of the Law."
   
   Of the Furniture of the Temple.
   
   In the East the Altar of Fire, & the Throne of the Beast,
   with Incense etc.
   In the West the Scarlet Woman, & the Altar of Sacrifice, the
   Wine etc.
   In the South the Throne of Aiwaz, with the Altar of ?
   In the North Iacchaion with the Table of the Scribe.
   In the Centre the Hexagonal Altar, with the Pantacle, the
   Image of the God -- our Aborted Man-Child, the Bell, & the
   Knife, the Oil & the Lamp, or candle.
   
   Of the Ceremony in General.
   
   The Formula of this Magick is this
   (1) Banish.
   (2) Purify.
   (3) Consecrate.
   (4) Equilibrate.
   (5) Make Oath.
   (6) Invoke, by song, dance, &c.
   (7) Make Iacchaion God, by Ether.
   (8) Sacrifice him to the Beast, who thus becomes God. Use
   here the accendat & the right Mantram, the Tu quies & the
   Quia Patris.
   (9) Sacrifice The Beast to the Scarlet Woman, using Her
   mantras F---- S---- etc. Ether at pleasure.
   (10) Consume the Elements, as by Amalantrah the Wizard we
   are taught, the Pantacle being of "Earth". (In parts 7 to 10
   weapons & robes may be laid on the throne of Aiwaz.)
   (11) Perform any scrying or utter any prophecies, as may be
   given. & at leisure & pleasure resume vestments & insignia.
   & close Temple. So far of these matters.
   
   Now we may begin our first Working by the Invocation of
   Hermes on His day with the Sun in 9 degrees Sagittarius, the
   Moon in 23 degrees Leo & Mercury in 19 degrees Scorpio one
   hour before Noon with him in the Zenith, sextile to Venus
   Jupiter & Saturn. In furtherance whereof, at eleven of the
   night of Monday, did The Beast work under The Scarlet Woman
   his Word, to make the Great Operation go aright. Immediately
   was The Beast inspired to a writing Mercurial, a satire upon
   the Fish: & thus wrote he some 14 or 15 hours.
   
   The Oath of the Cephaloedium Working.
   
   Hear All that we, TO MEGA THERION 9degree = 2square A.'.A.'.
   The Beast; Alostrael, The Scarlet Woman; & GENESTHAI odegree
   = 0square A.'.A.'. do now in the presence of TAHUTI most
   solemnly swear to devote ourselves to the Establishment of
   "The Book of the Law" as uttered by Aiwaz 93 to 66, by the
   Way of The Cephaloedium Working as in the record thereof it
   hath been written.
   Witness our Hands:
   
          To Mega Therion 9degree = 2square A.'.A.'. 666
                      Alostrael - 31-666-31.
                            Genesthai
   
   The Banquet of Fish & Yellow Wine was consumed & the Oath of
   the Working witnessed accordingly with ceremonial proper
   thereto, & concluded at 1:18 p.m. of the Day of Mercury
   which openeth the month called December.
   
   I ask a symbol for the next Day of the Working.
   
   IV - Earth of Moon: The formulation of the Restrictions &
   the dispelling of Ignorance. id est: make careful
   arrangements & ask for further Enlightenment. How should we
   obtain further Enlightenment?
   
   LII - Earth of Earth: "When one's resting is like that of
   the back & he loses all consciousness of self: when he walks
   in his own courtyard & Does not see any of the persons in it
   - then there will be no error."
   
   die Jovis: Began the Pantacle of XVI, & went on with my Fish
   Story; which by the way is the Blasting of the Old Tower of
   Jesus-Tyranny.
   
   de Martis: We have all three been sick in various ways, so
   that save for beginning the Painting of the Pantacle no work
   has been done. I ask a symbol to indicate our proper course
   of action:
   
   XX -- Airy part of Kteis. Cf. General symbol, I should
   suppose that this means that we can now begin again. What
   shall we do tomorrow die Mercuri?
   
   X -- Phallic part of Water. The Tiger. See line 6. Consider
   the whole course that is trodden & examine the presage which
   that gives. We still therefore invoke Tahuti, & read the
   record up to this point, then obtain illuminated Wisdom as
   to our course.
   
   This Operation was accordingly taken in hand at one o'clock,
   the afternoon on the Day of Jupiter.
   
   The formulation of the Primum Ens Melissae was however
   difficult. The Beast receiving a communication of a
   climatological character reminding him of his Lost Lustre.
   It is therefore incumbent to make a new divination task:
   what course is now proper to pursue? LXII: Let the matter
   take care of itself: enquire further on the next day of
   Mercury.
   
   dei Lunae: Dec. 13: At two o'clock this morning, after
   making my Confession. I laid my hand upon the Sacred Lotus
   of Alostrael & swore these Oaths: -- I. I ......., the Beast
   666 hereby & herein most solemnly promise & swear: to devote
   my whole working time exclusively to the completion of my
   Comment on "The Book of the Law."
   
   2. I, etc, as before etc. swear: that as soon as the Comment
   is ready, I will take the Book & cause it to be printed,
   bound & issued in the manner ordained in the Book itself,
   though I leave myself without money to buy my next meal
   
   To these oaths, I called Nuith! Hadith! Ra Hoor Khuit! as
   witnesses thereof. I then invoked Aiwaz to aid me to keep
   them, & in all other ways soever to forward the Work.
   
   2.20 a.m. - I therefore open my MS. of the Comment.
   
   Dec. 15. We seem to have been harassed by minor illnesses,
   so much as to be actually crippled; in fact I have been
   practically obliged to keep to my bed & Alostrael will take
   the divination concerning the working.
   
   How shall we proceed?
   
   LI. Fire of Fire: This seems to mean that a new current may
   be expected. This New Current turned up on the morning of
   Dec. 16 Die Jovis, in the shape of a letter from the printer
   of The Equinox III. The Oracle also means that we need to
   formulate the Yod of our Tetragrammaton; which rests with
   Frater Genesthai. He is at present the 'Pure Fool' & must
   acquire the Sacred Lance.
   
   Die Veneris: Dec. 24. I have been revising the Comment on
   "Liber Legis," with the aid of Alostrael, Iacchaion, & Jane
   Wolfe. This applies only to Chapter I; Chapter II I have
   revised with Iacchaion only, & Chapter III I have read
   through alone. I cannot express myself adequately about my
   sense of failure in this Comment. More I feel that I have
   not conquered my repulsion to Chapter III. I ask myself too:
   
   Have I even tried to carry out the instructions in that
   Chapter?
   
   I am utterly wretched about the whole matter. I say: have I
   not failed absolutely to obey the "Heavenly Vision"? I am so
   miserable that I can only see one course of action: to ask
   the Yi to give a General Symbol for my past Work in relation
   to "The Book of the Law."
   
   LIV - Kwei Mei: Alas! too true! I have been divided against
   myself: I have gone in just deep enough to compromise
   myself, not I when the whole hearted plunge would have
   brought success.
   
   I have been too irritably active, & not persistent enough.
   Give a symbol for my right course of action in regard to it
   'at the present time & thence onward. LVIII Tui.: Let there
   be an even flow of Love to it, a still & subtle dissolution.
   Water, the weakest thing in Nature is stronger than the
   strongest. Steady devotion without anxiety or fussiness will
   penetrate the Universe. Inward harmony & sincerity: the slow
   accumulation of Karma, constant concentration on the Law,
   utmost faith even in one's opponents, will gather the whole
   world into the fold of the Stars.
   
   Wed. Dec. 29. 1920 e.v. Current for this work going to-day &
   oath renewed in public. I spent all night writing on certain
   matters proper to the Comment --- 93 pages of MS.
   
   Dec. 30 1920 e.v. dei Jovis: At about ten o'clock of the
   forenoon The Beast & The Scarlet Woman performed a Mass of
   the Holy Ghost with the intention of establishing the Law.
   
   Jan. 3. 1921 e.v. Frater Iacchaion began a Working which
   continued throughout the whole night. The Beast accordingly
   was inspired to continue the Comment through the night
   following.
   
   Jan. 7. die Veneris: Awake most of the night in meditation.
   The Beast decided on a course of action with regard to the
   practical matters connected with the Book of the Law.
   
   (1) Consult Yi about recovery of the MS.
   (2) Push through Comment. The Yi gives Khwan (47) Watery
   part of Luna meaning Bring restriction to bear on the thief.
   
   Jan. 20. die Jovis: The Sun enters the Sign of Aquarius: I
   record that Frater Iacchaion, the Primum Mobile of the
   Working, having failed to initiate any Rashith Ha-Gilgalim,
   has caused the collapse of the whole Working, which I
   therefore declare ended. I now myself repair to the City of
   Paris, there to inaugurate an alternative course of
   procedure. 666 To Mega Therion 9degree = 2square A.'.A.'.
   
                     Here endeth the book of
                               The
                      Cephaloedium Working.
   
                     Iacchaion Altar of Fire
              & Table of Scribe Aiwaz Throne & Altar
                      Altar with Lamp, bell,

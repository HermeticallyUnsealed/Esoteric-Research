                          SUB FIGURA VI.

                                 I.

    1. This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use the
 most minute critical care in the study of it, even as we have done in the
 preparation.
    2. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, of Spirits
 and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may
 or may not exist.
    It is immaterial whether they exist or not.  By doing certain things
 certain results follow; students are most earnestly warned against
 attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.
    3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these:
      (a) A widening of the horizon of the mind.
      (b) An improvement of the control of the mind.
    4. the student, if he attains any success in the following practices, will
 find himself confronted by things (ideas or beings) too glorious or too
 dreadful to be described.  It is essential that he remain the master of all
 that he beholds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of
 illusion and the prey of madness.
    Before entering upon any of these practices the student must be in good
 health, and have attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama and Dharana.
    5. There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will
 fail to get some result; but there is a great danger that he will be led
 astray, even though it be by those which it is necessary that he should
 attain.  Too often, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place for the
 goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight is well
 begun.
    It is desirable that the student should never attach to any result the
 importance which it at first seems to possess.
    6. First, the, let us consider the Book 777 and its use; the preparation
 of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and finally the methods which
 follow in Chapter V.  "Viator in Regnis Arboris" and in Chapter VI "Sagitta
 trans Lunam."
    (In another book will be treated of the Expansion and Contraction of
 Consciousness; progress by slaying the Chakkrams; progress by slaying the
 Pairs of Opposites; the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, etc., etc.)



                                II.

    1. The student must first obtain a thorough knowledge of Book 777,
 especially of the columns printed elsewhere in this Book.
    When these are committed to memory, he will begin to understand the nature
 of these correspondences.  (See Illustrations in "The Temple of Solomon the
 King" in Equinox No. 2.  Cross references are given.)
    2. If we take an example, the use of the tables will become clear.
    Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some obscure science.
    In column XLV {Note 1}, line 12, you will find "Knowledge of Sciences."
    By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find that the
 Planet corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its lineal figures the
 octagon and octagram.  The God who rules that planet Thoth, or in Hebrew
 symbolism Tetragrammaton Adonai and Elohim Tzabaoth, its Archangel Raphael,
 its choir of Angels Beni Elohim, its Intelligence Tiriel, its Spirit
 Taphtatharath, its colours Orange (for Mercury is the Sphere of the Sephira
 Hod, 8) Yellow, Purple, Grey and Indigo rayed with Violet; its Magical Weapon
 the Wand or Caduceus, its Perfumes Mastic and others, its sacred plants
 Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal or Agate; its sacred animal the Snake,
 etc., etc.

                               -376-




    3. You would then prepare your Place of Working accordingly.  In an orange
 circle you would draw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose points you
 would place eight lamps.  The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to be found in
 Cornelius Agrippa and other books) you would draw in the four colours with
 such other devices as your experience may suggest.
    4. And so on.  We cannot here enter at length into all the necessary
 preparations; and the student will find them fully set forth in the proper
 books, of which the Goetia is perhaps the best example.
    These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary, the student
 should no nothing the object of which he does not understand; also, if he
 have any capacity whatever, he will find his own crude rituals more effective
 than the highly polished ones of other people.
    The general purpose of all this preparation is as follows:
    5. Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects, if it be his
 wish to master one particular idea, he must make every material object about
 him directly suggest that idea.  Thus, in the ritual quoted, if his glance
 fall upon the lights, their number suggests Mercury; he smells the perfumes,
 and again Mercury is brought to his mind.  In other words the whole magical
 apparatus and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics.
    (The importance of these lies principally in the fact that particular sets
 of images that the student may meet in his wanderings correspond to
 particular lineal figures, divine names, etc. and are controlled by them. As
 to the possibility of producing results external to the mind of the seer
 (objective in the ordinary common sense acceptation of the term) we are here
 silent.)
    6. There are three important practices connected with all forms of
 ceremonial (and the two Methods which later we shall describe).
 These are:
    (1) Assumption of God-forms.
    (2) Vibration of Divine Names.
    (3) Rituals of "Banishing" and "Invoking".
    These, at least, should be completely mastered before the dangerous
 Methods of Chapter V and VI are attempted.


                              III

    1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt should be made thoroughly
 familiar.  thiis can be done by studying them in any public museum, or in
 such books as may be accessible to the student.  They should then be
 carefully painted by him, both from the model and from memory.
    2. The student, seated in the "God" position, or in the characteristic
 attitude of the God desired, should then imagine His image as coinciding with
 his own body, or as enveloping it.  This must be practised until mastery of
 the image is attained, and an identity with it and with the God experienced.
    It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain tests of
 success in this practice exist.
    3. The Vibration of God-names.  As a further means of identifying the
 human consciousness with that pure portion of it which man calls by the name
 of some God, let him act thus:
    4. (a) Stand with arms outstretched {Note 1}.  (See illustration, in
 Equinox No. 2, p. 13).
    (b) Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of the God
 desired entering with the breath.
    (c) Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the solar
 plexus, the navel, the generative organs, and so to the feet.
    (d) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance the left
 foot about 12 inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands (drawn back
 to the side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing in the typical
 position of the God Horus, and at the same time imagine the Name as rushing
 up and through the nostrils with the air which has been till then retained in
 the lungs.  All this must be done with all the force of which you are
 capable.
    (e) Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger {Note 2}

 ----------------
 1. This injunction does not apply to gods like Phthah or Harpocrates
 whose natures do not accord with this gesture.
 2. Or the thumb, the fingers being closed.  The thumb symbolises
 spirit, the forefinger the element of water.


                               -378-




 upon the lips, so that you are in the characteristic position of the God
 Harpocrates.
    (f) It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a
 single "Vibration" entirely exhausts his physical strength.  It should cause
 him to grow hot all over or to perspire violently, and it should so weaken
 him that he will find it difficult to remain standing.
    6. It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it
 perceived, when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if
 by the concourse of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if
 that Great Voice proceeded from the Universe, and not from himself.
    In both the above practices all consciousness of anything but the God-form
 and name should be absolutely blotted out'; and the longer it takes for
 normal perception to return, the better.


                                IV.



    I. The Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram must be committed to memory;
 they are as follows ---

              The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram

     i. Touching the forehead say Ateh (Unto Thee),
    ii. Touching the breast say Malkuth (The Kingdom),
   iii. Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the Might),
    iv. Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the Glory),
     v. Clasping the hands upon the breast, say le-Olahm, Amen (To
           the Ages, Amen).
    vi. Turning to the East make a pentagram (that of Earth) with
         the proper weapon (usually the Wand).  Say (i.e. vibrate)
         HVHY.
   vii. Turning to the South, the same, but say YNDA.
  viii. Turning to the West, the same, but say HYHA.
    ix. Turning to the North, the same, but say ALGA (Pronounce:
           Ye-ho-wau, Adonai, Eheieh, Agla).
     x. Extending the arms in the form of a cross say,
    xi. Before me Raphael;
   xii. Behind me Gabriel;


                               -379-




  xiii. On my right hand , Michael.
   xiv. On my left hand, Auriel;
    xv. For about me flames the Pentagram,
   xvi. And in the Column stands the six-rayed Star.
   xvii-xxi. Repeat (i) to (v), the Qabalistic Cross.


                  The Greater Ritual of the Pentagram

    The Pentagrams are traced in the air with the sword or other weapon, the
 name spoken aloud, and the signs used, as illustrated.

    The Signs of the Portal (See illustrations): Extend the hands in front of
 you, palms outwards, separate them as if in the act of rending asunder a veil
 or curtain (actives), and then bring them together as if closing it up again
 and let them fall to the side (passives).

 the shoulders, bring the hands across the chest, touching the thumbs and tips
 of fingers so as to form a triangle apex downwards.  (See illustration).
    (The Grade of 3= = 8) is particularly attributed to the element of water;
 it refers to the planet Mercury; the paths of R and S are attributed to this
 degree.  For other attributions see 777, lines 8 and 23).

    The signs of 2= = 9).  Stretch both arms upwards and outwards, the elbows
 bent at right angles, the hand bent back, the palms upwards as if supporting
 a weight.  (See illustration).
    (The Grade of 2= = 9) is particularly attributed to the element Air; it
 refers to the Moon, the path of T is attributed to this degree.  For other
 attributions see 777 lines 9 and 11).

 See 777 lines 10 and 32 bis).


                The Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram.

    This ritual is to be performed after the "Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram".
    (I). Stand upright, feet together, left arm at side, right across body,
 holding Wand or other weapon upright in the median line.  Then face East and
 say:
    (II).  I.N.R.I.
           Yod, Nun, Resh, Yod.

           Sol, Osiris, Slain and Risen.
           Isis, Apophis, Osiris, IAW.
    (III). Extend the arms in the form of a cross, and say "The Sign of Osiris
 Slain."  (See illustration).
    (IV). Raise the right arm to point upwards, keeping the elbow square, and
 lower the left arm to point downwards, keeping the elbow square, while
 turning the head over the left shoulder looking down so that the eyes follow
 the left forearm, and say, "The Sign of the Mourning of Isis".  (See
 illustration).
    (V). Raise the arms at an angle of sixty degrees to each other above the
 head, which is thrown back, and say, "The Sign of Apophis and Typhon."  (See
 illustration).
    (VI). Cross the arms on the breast, and bow the head and say, "The Sign of
 Osiris Risen".  (See illustration).
    (VII). Extend the arms again as in (III) and cross them again as in (vi)
 saying: "L.V.X., Lux, the Light of the Cross".

 To invoke or banish planets or zodiacal signs.
 The Hexagram of Earth alone is used.  Draw the hexagram,


                               385-




 beginning from the point which is attributed to the planet you are dealing
 with.  (See 777 col. lxxxiii).  Thus to invoke Jupiter begin from the right
 hand point of the lower triangle, dextro-rotary and complete; then trace the
 upper triangle from its left hand point and complete.


       1* /\            2*--/\--#          Trace the astrological sigil

                                        (777, col. xxxviii) but draw
          /\ #            # /\         the astrological sigil of the
      --------\-        -/--------     sign, instead of that of the

      -\--------        --------/-
        # \/                \/ #

    For Caput and Cauda Draconis use the lunar hexagram, with the sigil of
 {Cauda Draconis} or {Caput Draconis}.
   To banish, reverse the hexagram.

   In all cases use a conjuration first with Ararita, and next with the name
 of the god corresponding to the planet or sign you are dealing with.
    The Hexagrams pertaining to the planets are as in plate on preceding page.
    2. These rituals should be practised until the figures drawn appear in
 flame, in flame so near to physical flame that it would perhaps be visible to
 the eyes of a bystander, were one present.  It is alleged that some persons
 have attained the power of actually kindling fire by these means.  Whether
 this be so or not, the power is not one to be aimed at.
    3. Success in "banishing" is known by a "feeling of cleanliness" in the
 atmosphere; success in "invoking" by a "feeling of holiness".  It is
 unfortunate that these terms are so vague.
    But at least make sure of this; that any imaginary figure or being shall
 instantly obey the will of the student, when he uses the appropriate figure.
 In obstinate cases, the form of the appropriate God may be assumed.
    4. The banishing rituals should be used at the commencement of any
 ceremony whatever.  Next, the student should use a general invocation, such
 as the "Preliminary Invocation" in the Goetia as well as a special invocation
 to suit the nature of his working.
    5. Success in these verbal invocations is so subtle a matter, and its
 grades so delicately shaded, that it must be left to the good sense of the
 student to decide whether or not he should be satisfied with his result.


                                 V.

    1. Let the student be at rest in one of his prescribed positions, having
 bathed and robed with the proper decorum.  Let the place of working be free
 from all disturbance, and let the preliminary purifications, banishings and
 invocations be duly accomplished, and, lastly, let the incense be kindled.
    2. Let him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the proper magical
 garments, and armed with the proper magical weapons) as enveloping his
 physical body, or standing near to and in front of him.
    3. Let him then transfer the seat of his consciousness to that imagined
 figure; so that it may seem to him that he is seeing with its eyes, and
 hearing with its ears.
    This will usually be the great difficulty of the operation.
    4. Let him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to a great
 height above the earth.
    5. Let him then stop and look about him.  (It is sometimes difficult to
 open the eyes.)
    6. Probably he will see figures approaching him, or become conscious of a
 landscape.
    Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon being answered, using the
 proper pentagrams and signs, as previously taught.
    7. Let him travel at will, either with or without guidance from such
 figure or figures.
    8. Let him further employ such special invocations as will cause to appear
 the particular places he may wish to visit.
    9. Let him beware of the thousand subtle attacks and deceptions that he
 will experience, carefully testing the truth of all with whom he speaks.
    Thus a hostile being may appear clothed with glory; the appropriate
 pentagram will in such a case cause him to shrivel or decay.
    10. Practice will make the student infinitely wary in such matters.
    11. It is usually quite easy to return to the body, but should any
 difficulty arise, practice (again) will make the imagination fertile.  For
 example, one may create in thought a chariot of fire with white horses, and
 command the charioteer to drive earthwards.
    It might be dangerous to go too far, or to stay too long; for fatigue must
 be avoided.
    The danger spoken of is that of fainting, or of obsession, or of loss of
 memory or other mental faculty.
    12. Finally, let the student cause his imagined body in which he supposes
 himself to have been travelling to coincide with the physical, tightening his
 muscles, drawing in his breath, and putting his forefinger to his lips. Then
 let him "awake" by a well-defined act of will, and soberly and accurately
 record his experiences.
    It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment is perfectly
 easy to perform.  It is best to learn by "travelling" with a person already
 experienced in the matter.  Two or three experiments should suffice to render
 the student confident and even expert.  See also "The Seer", pp. 295-333,
 Equinox I, 2.



                                VI.

    1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of
 importance.  But it is susceptible of a development which merges into a form
 of Dharana --- concentration --- and as such may lead to the very highest
 ends.  The principal use of the practice in the last chapter is to
 familiarise the student with every kind of obstacle and every kind of
 delusion, so that he may be perfect master of every idea that may arise in
 his brain, to dismiss it, to transmute it to cause it instantly to obey his
 will.
    2. Let him then being exactly as before, but with the most intense
 solemnity and determination.
    3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise
 in a line exactly perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his
 physical body is situated (or to put it more simply, straight upwards).
    4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost
 overcomes him.  If he should find that he has stopped without willing to do
 so, and that figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them.
    Yea, thought his very life tremble on his lips, let him force his way
 upward and onward!
    5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in him.
 Whatever threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and all his hosts
 loosed from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from the very
 Throne of God Himself that a voice issues bidding him stay and be content,
 let him struggle on, ever on.
    6. At last there must come a moment when his whole being is swallowed up
 in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia.{Note 1}  Let him sink (when no
 longer can he strive, though his tongue by bitten through with the effort and
 the blood gush from his nostrils) into the blackness of unconsciousness, and
 then, on coming to himself, let him write down soberly and accurately a
 record of all that hath occurred, yea a record of all that hath occurred.

                             EXPLICIT

 1. This in case of failure.  The results of success are so many and
 wonderful that no effort is here made to describe them.  They are classified,
 tentatively, in the Herb Dangerious, Part II, Equinox I, 2.

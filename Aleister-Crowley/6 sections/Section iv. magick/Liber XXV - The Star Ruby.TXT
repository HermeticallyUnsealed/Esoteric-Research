                          THE STAR RUBY.

   Facing East, in the centre, draw deep deep deep thy breath closing thy
 mouth with thy right forefinger prest against thy lower lip.  Then dashing
 down the hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling forcibly thy breath,
 cry A„O „ANTO‰ KAKOAIMONO‰.
   With the same forefinger touch thy forehead, and say ‰OI, thy member, and
 say Í ËAÔÔE {Note 1}, thy right shoulder, and say I‰XYPOS, thy left shoulder,
 and say EYXAPI‰TO‰; then clasp thine hands, locking the fingers, and cry IAÍ.
   Advance  to the East. Imagine strongly a Pentagram, aright, in thy forehead.
 Drawing  the hands to the eyes, fling it forth, making the sign of Horus and
 roar ÈÓPION.  Retire thine hand in the sign of Hoor-paar-Kraat.
   Go round to the North and repeat; but say NUIT.
   Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper BABALON.
   Go round to the South and repeat; but bellow HADIT.
   Completing the circle widdershins, retire to the centre and raise thy voice
 in the Paian, with these words IÍ „AN, with the signs of N.O.X.
   Extend the arms in the form of a Tau and say low but clear:

 „PO MOY IY‚‚E‰ O„IXÍ MOY TEÔETAPXAI E„I EIA
 XYNOXE‰ E„API‰TEPA AIMONO‰ ËÔE‚EI ‚AP „EPI
 MOY O A‰THR TÍN „ENTE KAI EN THI ‰THGHI
 Í A‰THR TÍN E E‰THKE.

   Repeat the Cross Qabalistic, as above, and end as thou didst begin.

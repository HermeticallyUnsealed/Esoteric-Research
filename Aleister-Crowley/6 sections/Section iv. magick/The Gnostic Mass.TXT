                            OF THE FURNISHINGS
                               OF THE TEMPLE

     In the East, that is, in the direction of Boleskine, which
     is situated on the south-eastern shore of Loch Ness in
     Scotland, two mile east of Foyers, is a shrine or High
     Altar.  Its dimensions should be 7 feet in length, 3 feet
     in breadth, 44 inches in height.  It should be covered with
     a crimson altar-cloth, on which may be embroidered
     fluer-de-lys in gold, or a sunblaze, or other suitable
     emblem.
        On each side of it should be a pillar or Obelisk, with
     countercharges in black and white.
        Below it should be the dais of three steps, in black and
     white squares.
        Above it is the super-altar, at whose top is the Stele of
     Revealing in reproduction, with four candles on each side
     of it.  Below the stele is a place for THE BOOK OF THE LAW,
     with six candles on each side of it.  Below this again is
     The Holy Graal, with roses on each side of it.  There is
     room in front of the Cup for the Paten.  On each side
     beyond the roses, are two great candles.
        All is enclosed within a great Veil.
        Forming the apex of an equilateral triangle whose base
     is a line drawn between the pillars, is a small black square
     altar, of superimposed cubes.
        Taking this altar as the middle of the base of a similar
     and equal triangle, at the apex of this second triangle is a
     small circular font.

                         OF THE OFFICERS OF THE MASS

        THE PRIEST. Bears the Sacred Lance, and is clothed at
     first in a plain white robe.
        THE PRIESTESS. Should be actually Virgo Intacta, or
     specially dedicated to the service of the Great Order.  She
     is clothed in white, blue, and gold.  She bears the Sword
     from a red girdle, and the Paten and Hosts, or Cakes of
     Light.
        THE DEACON. He is clothed in white and yellow.  He
     bears THE BOOK OF THE LAW.
        TWO CHILDREN. They are clothed in white and black.
     One bears a pitcher of water and a cellar of salt, the other
     a censer of fire and a casket of perfume.

                              OF THE CEREMONY
                               OF THE INTROIT

     THE DEACON, opening the doors of the Temple, admits
     the congregation, and takes his stand between the small
     altar and the font. (There should be a doorkeeper to
     attend to the admission.)
     THE DEACON, advances and bows before the open shrine
     where the Graal is exalted.  He kisses THE BOOK OF THE
     LAW three times, opens it, and places it upon the
     super-altar.  He turns West.
     THE DEACON. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of
     the Law.  I proclaim the Law of Light, Life, Love, and
     Liberty in the name of IAO.
     THE CONGREGATION.  Love is the law, love under will.
     THE DEACON goes to his place between the altar of
     incense and the font, faces east, and gives the step and
     the sign of a Man and a Brother.  All imitate him.
     THE DEACON AND ALL THE PEOPLE. I believe in one secret
     and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the Company of
     Stars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall
     return; and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in
     His name CHAOS, the sole viceregent of the Sun upon
     the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes.
        And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and
     in one Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein
     they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name
     BABALON.
        And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of
     Mystery, in his name BAPHOMET.
        And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of
     Light, Life, Love, and Liberty, the Word of whose Law
     is THELEMA.
        And I believe in the communion of Saints.
        And, for as much as meat and drink are transmuted in
     us daily into spiritual substance, I believe in the Miracle
     of the Mass.
        And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom, whereby we
     accomplish the Miracle of Incarnation.
        And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that
     was, and is, and is to come.
        AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN.

          Music is now played. THE CHILD enters with the ewer
          and the salt.  THE VIRGIN enters with the Sword and
          the Paten.  THE CHILD enters with then censer and the
          perfume.  They face THE DEACON, deploying into line,
          from the space between the two altars.
     THE VIRGIN. Greetings of Earth and Heaven!
          All give the Hailing sign of a Magician, THE DEACON
          leading.
          THE PRIESTESS, the negative child on her left, the
          positive on her right, ascends the steps of the High
          Altar, they awaiting her below.  She places the Paten
          before the Graal.  Having adored it, she descends, and
          with the children following her, the positive next her,
          she moves ina serpentine manner involving 3 1/2 circles of
          the Temple. (Deosil about altar, widdershins about
          font, deosil about altar and font, widdershins about
          altar and so to the Tomb in the West.) She draws her
          Sword, and pulls down the Veil therewith.
     THE PRISTESS. By the power of + Iron, I say unto thee
     Arise.  In the name of our Lord the + Sun, and of our
     Lord + ...that though mayst administer the virtues to
     the Brethren.
          She sheathes the Sword.
          THE PRIEST, issuing from the Tomb, holding the Lance
          erect with both hands, right over left, against his breast,
          takes the first three regular steps.
          He then gives the Lance to THE PRIESTESS, and gives
          the three penal signs.
          He then kneels, and worships the Lance with both hands.
          Penitential music.
     THE PRIEST. I am a man among mene
          He takes again the Lance, and lowers it.  He rises.
     THE PRIEST. How should I be worthy to administer the
     virtues to the Brethren?
          THE PRIESTESS takes from the child the water and the
          salt, and mixes them in the font.
     THE PRIESTESS. Let the salt of the Earth admonish the Water
     to bear the virtue of the Great Sea. (Genuflects.) Mother,
     be thou adored.
          She returns to the West.  + on PRIEST with open hand
          doth she make, over his forehead, breast, and body.
     Be The Priest pure of body and soul!
          THE PRIESTESS takes the censer from the child, and
        places it on the small altar.  She puts incense therein.
     Let the Fire and the Air make sweet the world! (Genuflects.)
     Father, be thou adored.
          She returns West, and makes + with the censer before
          the Priest, thrice as before.
     Be the Priest fervent of body and soul!
          (THE CHILDREN resume their weapons as they are done
          with.)
        THE DEACON now takes the consecrated Robe from the
        High Altar, and brings it to her.  She robes the Priest
        in his Robe of scarlet and gold.
     Be the flame of the Sun thine ambience, O thou Priest
     of the SUN!
        THE DEACON brings the crown from the High Altar.
        (The crown may be of gold or platinum, or of electrum
        magicum; but with no other metals, save the small
        proportions necessary to a proper alloy.  It may be
        adorned with divers jewels, at will.  But it must have
        the Uraeus serpent twined about it, and the cap of
        maintenance must match the scarlet of the Robe. Its
        texture should be velvet.)
     Be the Serpent they crown, O thou Priest of the LORD!
        Kneeling, she takes the Lance, between her open hands,
        and runs them up and down upon the shaft eleven times,
        very gently.
     Be the LORD present among us!
        All give the Hailing Sign.
     THE PEOPLE. So mote it be.

                                   IV

                         OF THE CEREMONY OF THE
                           OPENING OF THE VEIL

    THE PRIEST.  Thee therefore whom we adore we also
    invoke.
        By the Power of the lifted Lance!
          He raises the Lance.  All repeat Hailing Sign.
          A phrase of triumphant music.
          THE PRIEST takes the Priestess by her right hand
          with his left, keeping the Lance raised.
        I, PRIEST AND KING, take thee, Virgin pure without
     spot; I upraise thee; I lead thee to the East; I set thee
     upon the summit of the Earth.
          He thrones THE PRIESTESS upon the altar.  THE DEACON
          and the children follow, they in rank, behind him.
          THE PRIESTESS takes THE BOOK OF THE LAW, resumes
          her seat, and holds it open on her breast with her two
          hands, making a descending triangle with thumbs and
          forefingers.
          THE PRIEST gives the lance to THE DEACON to hold,
          and takes the ewer from the child, and sprinkles THE
          PRIESTESS, making five crosses, forehead, shoulders,
          and thighs.
          The thumb of THE PRIEST is always between his index
          and medius, whenever he is not holding the Lance.  THE
          PRIEST takes the censer from the child, and makes five
          crosses, as before.
          THE CHILDREN replace their weapons on their respective
          altars.
          THE PRIEST kisses THE BOOK OF THE LAW three times.
          He kneels for a space in adoration, with joined hands,
          knuckles closed, thumb in position aforesaid.
          He rises, and draws the veil over the whole altar.
          All rise and stand to order.
          THE PRIEST takes the lance from THE DEACON, and
          holds it as before, as Osiris or Pthah.  He circumam-
          bulates the Temple three times, followed by THE DEACON
          and the children as before. (These, when not using their
          hands, keep their arms crossed upon their breasts.)
          At the last circumambulation they leave him and go
          to the place between the font and the small altar, where
          they kneel in adoration, their hands joined palm to
          palm, and raised above their heads.
          All imitate this motion.
          THE PRIEST returns to the East, and mounts the first
          step of the altar.
     THE PRIEST. O circle of Stars whereof our Father is but
     the younger brother, marvel beyond imagination, soul of
     infinite space, before whom Time is ashamed, the mind
     bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto Thee
     may we attain, unless Thine Image be Love.  Therefore
     by seed and root and stem and bud and leaf and flower
     and fruit do we invoke Thee.
        Then the Priest answered and said unto the Queen of
     Space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light
     bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of
     sweat; O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever
     thus, that men speak not of thee as One but as None; and
     let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous.
          During his speech THE PRIESTESS must have divested
          herself completely of her robe (see CCXX, I:62.)
     THE PRIESTESS. But to love me is better than all things;
     if under the night-stars in the desert thou presently burn-
     est mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure
     heart, and the serpent flame therin, thou shalt come a
     little to lie in my bosom.  For one kiss wilt thou then be
     willing to give all; but whoso gives on particle of dust
     shall lose all in that hour.  Ye shall gather goods and store
     of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels, ye shall
     exceed the nations of earth in splendour and pride; but
     always in love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy.
     I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe,
     and covered with a rich head-dress.  I love you! I yearn
     to you!  Pale or purple, veiled or volumtuous, I who am
     all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost
     sense, desire you.  Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled
     splendour within you: come unto me! To me! To me!
     Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me per-
     fumes! Drink to me, for I love you! I love you.  I am the
     blue-lidded daughter of sunset; I am the naked brilliance
     of the voluptuous night-sky.  To me!  To me!
          THE PRIEST mounts to the second step.
     THE PRIEST. O secret of secrets that art hidden in the
     being of all that lives, not Thee do we adore, for that
     which adoreth is also Thou.  Thou art That, and That
     am I.
        I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in
     the core of every star.  I am Life, and the giver of Life;
     yet therefor is knowledge of me the knowledge of
     death.  I am alone; there is no God where I am.
          THE DEACON and all rise to their feet, with the Hailing
          sign.
     THE DEACON. But ye, O my people, rise up and awake.
        Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy and
     beauty.
        These are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.
        A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride.
        A feast for the three days of the writing of THE BOOK OF
     THE LAW.
        A feast for Tahuti and the children of the Prophet---
     secret, O Prophet!
        A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the
     Equinox of the Gods.
        A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and
     a greater feast for death.
        A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture.
        A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of
     uttermost delight.
          THE PRIEST mounts the third step.
     THE PRIEST.  Thou that art One, our Lord in the Universe
     the Sun, our Lord in ourselves whose name is Mystery of
     Mystery, uttermost being whose radiance enlightening
     the worlds is also the breath that maketh every God even
     and Death to tremble before Thee--By the Sign of Light
     + appear thou glorious upon the throne of the Sun.
        Make open the path of creation and of intelligence
     between us and our minds.  Enlighten our understanding.
        Encourage our hearts.  Let thy light crystallize itself in
     our blood, fulfilling us of Resurrection.

     THE PRIESTESS. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.
        THE PRIEST parts the veil with his lance, During the
        previous speeches THE PRIESTESS has, if necessary, as
        in savage countries, resumed her robe.
     THE PRIEST: IO IO IO IAO SABAO
        KURIE ABRASAX  KURIE MEITHRAS  KURIE PHALLE.
                 IO PAN  IO PAN PAN

        CHAIRE PHALLE  CHAIRE PAMPHAGE  CHAIRE PANGENETOR.
                 HAGIOS HAGIOS HAGIOS IAO.
        THE PRIESTESS is seated with the Paten in her right
        hand and the cup in her left.
        THE PRIEST presents the Lance, which she kisses eleven
        times.  She then holds it to her breast, while THE PRIEST,
        falling at her knees, kissess them, his arms stretched
        along her thighs.  He remains in this adoration while
        THE DEACON intones the collects.
        All stand to order, with the Dieu Garde, that is, feet
        square, hands, with linked thumbs, held loosely.  This
        is the universal position when standing, unless other
        direction is given.

     perpetual radiance hearten us to continual labour and
     enjoyment; so that as we are constant partakers of thy
     bounty we may in our particular orbit give out light and

          none other should be present, having signified their
          intention, a whole Cake of Light, and a whole goblet
          of wine, having been prepared for each one.
          THE DEACON marshalls them; they advance one by one
          to the altar. THE CHILDREN take the Elements and offer
          them. THE PEOPLE communicate as did THE PRIEST,
          uttering the same words in an attitude of Resurrection:
          There is no part of me that is not of the Gods.
          The exceptions to this part of the ceremony are when
          it is of the nature of a celebration, in which case none
          but THE PRIEST communicate; or part of the ceremony
          of marriage, when none other, save the two to be married,
          partake; part of the ceremony of baptism, when only
          the child baptised partakes; and of Confirmation at
          puberty, when only the persons confirmed partake.  The
          Sacrament may be reserved by THE PRIEST, for ad-
          ministration to the sick in their homes.)

     true Wills, the Great Work, the Summum Bonum, True
     Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.
          He goes out, The Deacon and children following,
          into the Tomb of the West.

          Note. THE PRIESTESS and other officers never partake
          of the Sacrament, they being as it were part of THE
          PRIEST himself.
          Note. Certain secret Formulae of this Mass are taught
          to THE PRIEST in his Ordination.

   This is a single page in the correct format, but that format includes
features which cannot be reproduced in ASCII.  Here is a description:
In the top quarter of the page is an elongated Hebrew letter Taw, and within
this letter are all the other Hebrew letters except Taw, arranged in three rows and seven columns.  These Hebrew letters proceed from right to left
thusly:
1st row: ZAIN      VAU       HEH       DALET     GIMEL     BET       ALEPH
2nd row: NUN       MEM       LAMED     KAPH      YOD       TET       CHET
3rd row: SHIN      RESH      QOF       TZADDI    PE        AYIN      SAMEKH
The text given below is presented vertically below each of the seven columns,
beginning on the right.  The text is bordered on right and left by lotus wands.

THE WORKS OF ALEISTER CROWLEY    Vol. II, part 2 of 3   XYWrite VERSION

File 2 of 3.


This work was originally published in two parallel columns.  Where such
columns are found in the original, they have been rendered as a single text
with "A" or "B" added to the page number at the end of each column: A = end
page left column.  B = end page right column.  On many pages a prefatory
paragraph or a concluding group of sentences is full across the page.  These
instances are noted in curly brackets.

Pages in the original are marked thus at the bottom:  {page number} or {page
number A} and {page number B}.
Comments and descriptions are also set off by curly brackets {}
Comments and notes not in the original are identified with the initials of the
source: e.g.  WEH note = Bill Heidrick note, etc.  Descriptions of
illustrations are not so identified, but are simply in curly brackets.

   Text Footnotes have been expanded at or near the point of citation within double angle brackets, e.g. <<footnote>>.  For poems, most longer footnotes are cited in the text to expanded form below the stanzas.

<<1. This play, written when Crowley was studying Hindu religion, derives much of its colour and philosophical import from Pataiyali, the Upanishads and Sankarachariya's commentary, Shaivite mysticism, the Bhagavat Purana, Bhagavat Gita, and Vedantist literature in general.>>


                   ARGONAUTAE.

                  "ACTUS PRIMUS."

                      JASON.

    PELIAS.  JASON.  "Semi-chorus of Iochian" Men.  "Semi-chorus of Iolchian"
        Women.

      SCENE:  "The Throne-chamber of" KING PELIAS.


               SEMI-CHORUS OF MEN.
      THE prophecies are spoken in vain,
        The auguries vainly cast,
      Since twenty years of joyous reign
        In peace are overpast;
      And those who cursed our King's desires
      Are branded in the brow for liars.

              SEMI-CHORUS OF WOMEN.
      We heard the aged prophet speak
        The doom of woe and fear.
      We wait with blanched and icy cheek
        The one-and-twentieth year:
      For Justice lies, as seeds lie, dead,
      But lifts at last a Gorgon head!

                       MEN.
      What fear can reach our Thessaly?
        What war disturb our peace?
      Long stablished is young amity
        Maid-blushing over Greece:
      And fair Iolchus stands sublime,
      A monument to lesson time.  {86A}

                      WOMEN.
      But if such fear were come indeed,
        Who reads the riddle dread
      Spoken in frenzy by the seer
        Against the royal head?
      We know the Rhyme's involving spell --
      Its purport?  Irresolvable!

                       MEN.
      We heard his foolish maundering:
        But, bred in wiser ways,
      We have forgotten: do ye sing
        The rune of ancient days!
      To-day his curse cacophonous
      Shall earn at least a laugh from us!

                      WOMEN.
      "O! when the armed hand is nigh,
        Iolchus shall not see
      Peace shining from Athena's sky
        Until the Fleece be free;
      Until the God of War shall scorn
      The sting, and trust him to the horn.

      "Until the Sun of Spring forsake
        His eastern home, and rise
      Within our temple-walls and make
        One glory of the skies --
      Until the King shall die and live,
      Athena never shall forgive."

                       MEN.
      Surely, O friends, at last 'tis clear
        The man was mad indeed!
      Such nonsense we did never hear
        As this prophetic screed!
      More, as 'tis never like this land
      Should ever see an armed hand.  {86B}

                      JASON.
    Where is the son of Tyro and Poseidon?

                       MEN.
    Iolchus' King has here a dwelling-place.

                      WOMEN.
    See you the sword shake -- and the iron hand
    Not shaking?  The man's mood is full of wrath.

                       MEN.
    Peace, foolish!  Were it so, we would not see.

                      WOMEN.
    Ay me! this stranger seems most ominous.

                      JASON.
    Where is the son of Tyro and Poseidon?

                       MEN.
    This is the Palace-place of Pelias,
    Son of Poseidon, Of Iolchus King.

                      JASON.
    Iolchus' King is here, in very truth.
    Where is the son of Tyro?

                       MEN.
                               Who art thou?

                      JASON.
    Know me for Jason and great Aeson's heir.

                       MEN.
    We learn good news, most enviable sir;
    That Aeson hath such grand inheritance.

                      JASON.
    You have grown fat beneath an evil rule.
    Your period is at hand.  Go, one of you,
    And drag the impious wretch before my sight!

                       MEN.
    Aeson?  Thy father?  {87A}

                      JASON.
                      Play not with my wrath!
    My mood is something dangerous.

                       MEN.
                                 Dangerous sir,
    I go indeed, to bring some danger more
    Hither.

                      JASON.
             Poltroonery dislikes the wise.
    Fair maidens, I salute you pleasantly.

                      WOMEN.
      Welcome, O welcome to the land,
        Young heir of prophecy!
      The armed hand, the glittering brand,
        The scabbard's jewellery!
      That wealth avails not: cast it down!
      The sword alone may win the crown!

                      JASON.
    Ye languish wretched in the tyrant's rule?

                      WOMEN.
    Most happy are we, King.  But change is sweet.

                      JASON.
    A short-lived omen of success to me.

                      WOMEN.
    Nay, but adventure and the prophecy!

                      JASON.
    I see I have but small support in you.

                      WOMEN.
    Not so, great Jason!  Had I suffered much,
    My spirit had been broken to the scourge.
    Now, being strong and happy, with what joy
    I cry: Evohe!  Revolution!
    I have grown weary of this tiresome peace.

                      JASON.
    I promise you intense unhappiness.  {87B}

                      WOMEN.
    Here is the ugly monster!  Out!  To think
    We once believed him reverend and refined,
    Saw majesty in all that tottering gait,
    And honour in the goat-like beard of him!

                   FIRST WOMAN.
    A week ago your blue eyes were in tears,
    Sidelong regarding the old montebank.

                  SECOND WOMAN.
    To-day I would not be his concubine
    For all Iolchus -- for all Thessaly!

                   THIRD WOMAN.
    I see the same glance seek out Jason now.

                  SECOND WOMAN.
    Ay, there's a man!  What muscles!  What fine fire
    In the quick eye!  What vigour and warm strength!

                   FIRST WOMAN.
    Yes, in your wishes.  But indeed he is
    A proper man.  Away, you ancient egg!

                     PELIAS.
    With what audacious foot and impious voice
    Strides this young man and talks?  Let him advance,
    Trembling at our offended majesty.
    Who art thou whose rude summons startles us
    From work of state to listen a young mouth
    Beardless?  Speak, man, for shortly thou shalt die.

                      JASON.
    Athena speaks.

                      WOMEN.
           Ah, there's a  fine retort!

                     PELIAS.
    Goddesses speak and men list reverently.
    Could he not find a fitter messenger?  {88A}

                      JASON.
    Her cause is Jason's.  Jason therefore speaks.

                     PELIAS.
    Aha!  A suppliant to our clemency!
    I did mistake the gesture and the sword
    Angrily gripped, the foot flung terribly
    Foremost, the fierce, constrained attitude.
    But -- as a suppliant!  Tell thy woeful tale,
    Sad youth!  Some woman thou hast loved and lost?

                      JASON.
    Thou hast robbed me of this kingdom.  Thou hast kept
    My father (poor half-witted man!) a slave
    And parasite about thy court (one grief
    The more I add to this account of thine!)
    Myself a babe thou didst seek out to slay,
    And, I being hid, with fish-hooks bent with lies
    And gilded with most spacious promises,
    Cunningly angled for old Chiron's<<1>> grace
    To catch me yet.  Athena hears me swear
    To right all this -- nay, answer me before
    Anger get all the spoil of me, and drink
    Thy life-blood in one gulp!  Descend that dais!
    Bend thou a suppliant at my awful knee,
    And thus -- perhaps -- at least get grace of life.

<<1. A Centaur who hid the child Jason.>>

                     PELIAS.
    And if I say I will not yield the throne?

                      JASON.
    I am of force to take it.

                     PELIAS.
                             Are my friends
    Not faithful?  Who draws sword for Pelias?

                       MEN.
    Shall we not slay thee this presumptuous fool?  {88B}

                      JASON.
    I am of force, I say.  I wrestled once
    From sunrise to sunset with Heracles,
    Great Heracles!  Not till the full moon rose
    Availed his might to lay me prone.  Beware!
    Ye weakling knaves!  I am of force, I say.

                     PELIAS.
    Rebellious youth, the justice of thy cause
    And force I will admit -- where force goes far.
    But think'st thou wait no wild Erinyes
    For thee a guest in these my halls, for thee
    Whose hands are dipped not yet in blood so deep
    As to have murdered an old man, and him
    Thy father's brother?

                      JASON.
                         Justice covers all.
    The Furies cannot follow if a man
    To his own heart be reconciled.  They feed
    On his own bosom, nay! are born thereof.
    An alien clan he might elude, but these,
    Blood of his blood, he shall nor slay nor 'scape.
    My heart hath never pastured on regret
    Or pang for thee.  My justice covers all.

                     PELIAS.
    That one word "justice" covers all indeed
    To thine own self.  But think'st thou for a word
    To ruin many years of commonweal,
    And poison in an hour the politics
    Of states and thrones for -- justice?  Thou art just;
    But wisdom, but the life of innocents,
    The happiness of all, are better served
    By solemn thought an weighty counsel held.

                      JASON.
    This is more simple.  I abolish thee --
    One sword-sweep -- and assume thy "politics."  {89A}

                     PELIAS.
    Thou art this "simple"!  Will my liege allies
    (Willing with age and wisdom to accord)
    Not tremble at thy firebrand breed, not think
    Who hath in blood, an old man's blood, made fast
    A perilous footing, may betimes discover
    More "justice" -- and invasion footing it
    Hard after?  Wilt thou plunge all Thessaly,
    All Greece, in haste and sudden armament,
    Fury of thought and frenzy of deed, at once
    For justice?  Wouldst thou be so violent
    For justice, save in thine own cause, O boy?
    And wilt thou pity not the happy days
    And storm-unshattered abodes of Greece?

                      JASON.
    Athena, who is Justice, also is
    Wisdom: and also "She who buildeth towns."

                     PELIAS.
    Think also, I am born of deity.
    I am inured to majesty; I know
    How venerable is the sight of Kings,
    And how the serpent Treason writhes beneath
    The royal foot, conscious of its own shame,
    And how the lion of Rebellion cowers
    Before the presence of a king unarmed,
    Quelled by one mild glance of authority.

                      JASON.
    A king unjust is shorn of majesty.

                     PELIAS.
    Still the one fool's word -- justice -- answers all.
    Would thou wert older and more politic!

                      JASON.
    Would I were liar with thine own foul brand!
    The gods are weary of thy cozening.  {89B}

                     PELIAS.
    To proof, then, boy.  I lay my sceptre by,
    Put off my crown, descend the steps to thee.
    Here is my breast.  Look firmly in my face,
    And slay me.  Is there fear writ large and deep
    In mine old eyes?  Or shudderest thou with fear?

                      JASON.
    More hate than fear.  In sooth, I cannot strike.

                     PELIAS.
    A king is not so slain -- except a madman
    May fall upon him with averted head.<<1>>
    Indeed, I conquer.  ["Aside."]  Even so, beware!
    Victory ill-nurtured breeds the babe defeat.
    ["Aloud."]  Listen, my brother's son!  Nay, stoop not so,
    Bending ashamed brows upon the earth!
    I am well weary of the world of men.
    I grow both old and hateful to myself,
    Most on the throne: power which to youth is sweet
    To age looks fearful.  Also I have wept --
    Alas! how often! -- and repented me
    Of those unkingly deeds whereby I gained
    This throne whose joy is turned to bitterness.
    I will make peace with thee, and justice still
    Shall have a home and shrine in Thessaly.
    Be patient notwithstanding!  Prove thyself
    Valiant and wise -- and reign here!  If in sooth
    An aged counsellor, whose reverend hair
    Commands a hearing, may assist at all,
    Wisdom to wisdom added, I am here.
    Yet would I rather slide into my grave,
    Untroubled with the destinies of states,
    Even of such an one so dear to me
    Who thus a score of years have nurtured it.  {90A)

<<1. These two lines are directly taken from Eliphaz Levi.>>

                      JASON.
    I hear thee.  Thou art grown like royal wine
    Better with age.  Forgive my violence!

                     PELIAS.
    ["Aside."]  The fish bites hard.  ["Aloud."]  There is a prophecy:
    "Once stirred, Iolchus never shall know peace
    Till in its temple hangs the Golden Fleece."
    Now thou hast so disquieted our days,
    The time is come: seek thou Aea's<<1>> isle,
    And hang this trophy on our temple walls!

<<1. Colchis, a county of Asia, bounded on the W. by the Euxine, on the N. by the Caucasus, and on the E. by the Iberia. Distinguished for Aeaea.>>

                      JASON.
    Tell me what is this fleece.

                     PELIAS.
                         Let women sing.

                      WOMEN.
      In Ares' grove, the sworded trees,
        The world's heart wondering,
      Hangs evermore the Golden Fleece,<<1>>
        The glory of the spring,
      The light of far Aea's coast.
      Such glamour as befits a ghost.

<<1. The symbolism of the Fleece and its guardians is curious.  The Fleece is of (Aries) Ares the Ram, the sign of the spring.  The sun being exalted in this sign, the fleece is called golden. Ares or Mars (Mars) is in Astrology the ruler of this sign.  His other house is Scorpio (Scorpio) the Dragon.  The whole legend is thus a glyph of the Magnum Opus.  That Crowley neglects this is a significant mark of the change to his maturer manner.>>

      Before that glittering woof the Sun
        Shrinks back abashed in shame,
      The splendour of the shining one,
        One torrent-fleece of flame!
      What heart may think, what tongue may sing
      The glory of the golden thing?  {90B}

      About the grove the scorpion coils
        Inextricably wind
      Within the wood's exceeding toils,
        The shadow hot and blind;
      There lurk his serpent sorceries,
      The guardian of the Golden Fleece.

      The dragon lifts his nostrils wide
        And jets a spout of fire;
      The warrior questing turns aside,
        Not daring to desire;
      And Madness born of Ares lurks
      Behind the wonder of his works.

      Be sure that were the woodland way
        Tracked snakewise to the core,
      The dragon slain or driven away,
        The good Fleece won by war,
      Not yet should Ares sink his spear,
      Or fail of flinging forth a fear.

      The torch of Madness should be lit,
        And follow him afar:
      Upon his prow should Madness sit,
        A baleful beacon-star;
      And in his home Despair and strife
      Lie in his bosom for a wife!

      But oh, the glory of the quest,
        The gainless goodly prize!
      The fairest form man e'er caressed,
        The word he heard most wise; --
      All lures of life avoid and cease
      Before the winning of the Fleece!

      O nameless splendour of the Gods,
        Begotten hardly of Heaven!
      Unspoken treasure of the abodes
        Beyond the lightning levin!
      No misery, no despair may pay
      The joy to hold thee for a day!

                      JASON.
    Athena's servant recks not much of Ares.

                     PELIAS.
    Are thine eyes kindled at the golden thought?  {91A}

                      JASON.
    Mine eyes see farther than the Fleece of Gold.

                     PELIAS.
    What heroes can attain so fair a thing?

                      JASON.
    I have some friends who would esteem this quest
    Lightly -- a maiden's pleasure-wandering
    Through lilied fields a summer's afternoon.

                     PELIAS.
    The Gods give strength!  I pray them send thee back
    Safe to this throne.

                      JASON.
                        I will not see thy face
    Ever again until the quest be won.
    Rule thou with justice in my sacred seat
    Until I come again.

                     PELIAS.
                          The Gods thy speed.

                       MEN.
      The hardy hero goes to find
        The living Fleece of Gold;
      Or else, some death may chance to bind
        Those limbs of manly mould.
      In sooth, I doubt if I shall earn
      The singer's fee for his return.

                     PELIAS.
    Think now -- I feared that fool.  It must be true
    That guilt is timorous.  Ay! when danger's none!
    Let but swords flash -- and guilt grows God for might!
    Indeed I rule -- until he come again.
    Ay, when the stars fall, Jason shall be king!

        THE sound of the hammer and steel!
          The song of the level and line!
        The whirr of the whistling wheel!
          The ring of the axe on the pine!

        The joy of the ended labour,
          As the good ship plunges free
        By sound of pipe and tabor
          To front the sparkling sea!

        The mystery-woven spell!
          The voyage of golden gain!
        The free full sails that swell
          On the swell of the splendid main!

        The song of the axe and the wedge!
          The clang of the hammer and chain!
        Keen whistle of chisel and edge!
          Smooth swish of the sliding plane!

        Hail to the honour of toil!
          Hail! to the ship flown free!
        Hail! to the golden spoil,
          And the glamour of all the sea!

                    HERACLES.
    A good stout song, friend Argus, matching well
    The mighty blows thou strikest: yet methinks
    One blow should serve to drive yon nail well home
    Where thou with tenfold stroke --  {92A}

                     THESEUS.
                            Good Heracles!
    Not all men owe thy strength ---

                      ARGUS.
                            Nay, let him try!
    Take my toy hammer!

                    HERACLES.
                        I have split the wood!

                     THESEUS.
    Vexation sits tremendous on his brow.
    Beware a hero's fury!  Thou art mad,
    Argus, to play so dangerous a trick.

                      ARGUS.
    True, Theseus -- if he had but hit his thumb!

                     CASTOR.
    Cease this fool's talk.  The moon waits not the work.

                     POLLUX.
    The sun will sink no later for your pleasure.
    on to thy work, man.

                     THESEUS.
                         He that traps a lion
    And baits him for an hour, and lets him go,
    Does well to think before he tempt again
    The forest paths.

                    HERACLES.
                     The wise man wisely thinks
    That nothing is but wisdom -- and myself
    Think strongly that no other thing exists
    But strength: so with his subtleties of mind
    He baffles me; and I lift up my club,
    And with one blow bespatter his wise brains.

                      JASON.
    Ay, not for nothing did the darkness reign
    Those eight-and-forty hours,<<1>> O Zeus-begot!{92B}

<<1. Zeus caused a night to extend to this length, that he might efficiently beget Hercules.>>

                     THESEUS.
    Tell me, friend master, how the work goes on.
    When shall our gallant vessel breast the deep?
    When shall we see the sun sink o'er the poop,
    And look toward moonrise, and the land be lost,
    And the perched watcher on the mast behold
    The melting mirror of the ocean meet
    The crystallising concave of the sky?

                      ARGUS.
    All this shall happen when the work is done.

                      JASON.
    How many moons, friend fool, before that day?

                      ARGUS.
    These things are known not even to the Gods,
    Except the Father only.<<1>>

<<1. The satire is on Matthew xxiv. 36.>>

                    HERACLES.
                            Fools must talk,

                      ARGUS.
    I talk, divulging nothing.

                    HERACLES.
                              I strike thee,
    Yet act not.

                      ARGUS.
                    Hero, stay that heavy hand!
    The ship shall sail ere spring.

                     THESEUS.
                              But now you talk
    More as befits a workman to a king.  {93A}

                      JASON.
    Be gentle now, my friends!  These shipbuilders,
    Reared in the rugged borders of the North,<<1>>
    Have northern manners; surly if attacked,
    But genial when ---

<<1. Argus is wittily characterised as a Scottish shipbuilder.>>

                      ARGUS.
                        The proper treatment is
    Kindness -- like lions whom Demeter tamed.

                     THESEUS.
    I promise thee, the next time thou art wroth,
    A second kindness from Alcides' hand.

                      ARGUS.
    Spare me that, King, and take, thyself, a club.

                      JASON.
    King Theseus, thou art far reputed wise.
    Hast thou not learnt a lesson from the hap
    Of Heracles supreme in -- shipbuilding?
    I by my meekness will abash thy strength.
    Good Argus, thou art unsurpassed in art
    To curve the rougher timbers, to make smooth
    The joints and girders, and to plane and work
    The iron and the nailheads, and to lift
    Row after row the tiers of benches thrice
    In triple beauty, and to shape the oars,
    To raise the mast ---

                      ARGUS.
                    Thy knowledge staggers me!
    How wast thou thus instructed?

                      JASON.
                            By much thought.
    To clamp the decks --- {93B}

                      ARGUS.
                     I stand with brows abashed.
    Thou art the master -- build the ship thyself.

                      JASON.
    Nay, but my knowledge is of mind alone.
    I cannot so apply it as to build
    An Argo.

                      ARGUS.
                  Yet I verily believe
    Such mind must pierce far deeper than these names,
    Seeking the very nature of the things
    Thou namest thus so pat.  Perchance to thee
    These logs, nails, bolts, tools, have some life of sense,
    Some subtle language.  Tell us what they say!<<1>>

<<1. The gibe in these twenty lines is against Rudyard Kipling's silly vitalisation of machinery, and his ignorance even of the correct terms.>>


                     THESEUS.
    'Tis but a giber -- leave the churl alone.

                      JASON.
    Indeed I spake of things I knew not of.

                      ARGUS.
    You speak more wisely when you float away
    Into pure dream, and talk of mystic things
    That no man born of woman understands,
    And therefore does not dare to contradict.

                      JASON.
    He who speaks much and bitterly at last
    Lays himself open to retort.  I think
    I never heard such contradictions fly
    As when men talk of gods -- that never were!

                      ARGUS.
    Thou wouldst do better to leave man alone.
    The wisest talk is folly when work waits.
    Look! how these sturdy villains gape around,
    Fling down their task, and hang upon the words
    That flow like nectar from your majesty.  {94A}

                     CASTOR.
    In truth, my friend, if you would wear your crown
    This side of Orcus, you should go away.

                     POLLUX.
    Ay! let the men work!  For a mind as yours
    Is good, and skill as theirs is also good.

                     CASTOR.
    But mix the manual and the mental -- well,
    No ship was built by pure philosophy.

                     POLLUX.
    Nor yet designed by artisans.

                      JASON.
                              Enough!
    Come, great Alcides, it is time to go.

                      ARGUS.
    A fool allows a moment's irritation
    To move the purpose of a thousand years.
    Go, go!

                    HERACLES.
            Remember!  We are met this day
    To call upon the name with praise and prayer
    Of great Athena, since our ship is built
    With sculptured olive pregnant in the prow,
    And all the length of pine is coiled and curled
    With the swift serpent's beauty, and the owl
    Sits in huge state upon the midmost bench.
    Thus, therefore, by the manifest design,
    Joining the wisdom to the power and will,
    We build the Argo.

                      ARGUS.
                         What a heavy club
    We carry!  And how well becomes our figure
    The lion's skin!

                    HERACLES.
                      Be still, thou art an ass!  {94B}

                      ARGUS.
    The fabled, ass, O Zeus-descended one?

                    HERACLES.
    What ass?

                      ARGUS.
                 The one that wore the lion's skin!

                     THESEUS.
    This fellow were beneath a man's contempt.
    How should a God-born heed him?

                      JASON.
                                We are here,
    Then, to invoke Athena, immolate
    the sacred cock upon her altar-stone,
    That She, who sprang in armour from the brain
    Of the All-Father, may descend to bless
    Our labours, since delay grows dangerous,
    If haply by Her power and subtlety
    She please to aid the work, and to perform
    A prodigy to save us!  Mighty Queen,
    That art the balance and the sword alike
    In cunning Argus' brain ---

                    HERACLES.
                        Ay!  Mighty Wisdom,
    Who thus can overshadow such a fool,
    And make him capable to build a ship.

                      ARGUS.
    O thou!  Athena, whose bright wisdom shone
    In this beef-witted fellow, making him
    Competent even to sweep a stable out!
    Glorious task! -- I shall return anon.

                      JASON.
    Nay, follow not!  The Goddess were displeased,
    Coming, to find our greatest hero gone.

                     THESEUS.
    This is the midmost hour of day.  {95A}

                      JASON.
                                  Arise,
    All heroes, circling round the sacred stone
    In beautiful order and procession grave,
    While our chief priest, our mightiest in song,
    The dowered of Phoebus, great Oeager's heir,
    Invokes that glory on the sacrifice
    That kindles all its slumber into life
    And vivid flame descending on the wheel
    And chariot of lightning, licking up
    The water of the loud-resounding sea
    Lustral, poured seven times upon the earth,
    And in one flash consuming wood and stone
    And the sweet savour of the sacrifice.

                     ORPHEUS.
    But when the flame hath darted from the eye
    Of my divine existence, and hath left
    Nothing, where was the altar and the earth,
    The water and the incense and the victim --
    Nothing of all remains!  Then look to it
    That ye invoke not Wisdom by the Name
    Of bright Athena!

                      JASON.
                       We are here to call
    Upon that Wisdom by that mighty Name!

                     ORPHEUS.
    Who calleth upon Wisdom is not wise.
    Is it not written in the Sibyl's book<<1>>
    That Wisdom crieth in the streets aloud
    And none regardeth her?  Obey my voice.

<<1. Actually Proverbs i, 20.>>

                      JASON.
    O master of Apollo's lyre and light!
    We are not wise -- and for that very cause
    We meet to-day to call on Wisdom.

                     ORPHEUS.
                                        Well!
    The altar stands, shadowing the Universe
    That with my fire of Knowledge I destroy --
    And there is Wisdom -- but invoke Her not,
    Friends, who is only when none other is.  {95B}

                      JASON.
    Let us begin: the hour draws on apace.
    Drive off the demons from the sacrifice!

                     ORPHEUS.
    Let all the demons enter and dwell therein!
    My friends, ye are as ignorant as priests!
    Let there be silence while the sleeper<<1>> wakes!

<<1. The Hindus hold that the Kundalini, the spring of spiritual power, lies coiled and sleeping upon a lotus-flower at the base of the spine.  She may be aroused by various methods.>>

      O coiled and constricted and chosen!
        O tortured and twisted and twined!
      Deep spring of my soul deep frozen,
        The sleep of the truth of the mind!
          As a bright snake curled
          Round the vine of the World!

      O sleeper through dawn and through daylight,
        O sleeper through dusk and through night!
      O shifted from white light to gray light,
        From gray to the one black light!
          O silence and sound
          In the far profound!

      O serpent of scales as an armour
        To bind on the breast of a lord!
      Not deaf to the Voice of the Charmer,
        Not blind to the sweep of the sword!
          I strike to the deep
          That thou stir in thy sleep!

      Rise up from mine innermost being!
        Lift up the gemmed head to the heart!
      Lift up till the eyes that were seeing
        Be blind, and their life depart!
          Till the eye that was blind<<1>>
          Be a lamp to my mind!  {96A}

<<1. The "third eye," that rudimentary eye called the pineal gland.>>

      Coil fast all they coils on me, dying,
        Absorbed in the sense of the Snake!
      Stir, leave the flower-throne, and upflying
        Hiss once, and hiss thrice, and awake!
          Then crown me and cling!
          Flash forward -- and spring!

      Flash forth on the fire of the altar,
        The stones, and the sacrifice shed;
      Till the Three Worlds<<1>> flicker and falter,
        And life and her love be dead!
          In mysterious joy
          Awake -- and destroy!

<<1. Of gods, men, and demons.>>

                      JASON.
    It is enough!

                    HERACLES.
                   Too great for a god's strength!

                     THESEUS.
    Speak!

                     CASTOR.
            Change!  Not to be borne!

                     POLLUX.
                             But this is death!

                     ORPHEUS.
    Let the light fade.  The oracle is past.

                      JASON.
    The Voice is past.  We are alive again.

                     ORPHEUS.
    What spake That Silence?

                    HERACLES.
                           "This is not a quest
    Where strength availeth aught."  I shall not go.  {96B}

                      JASON.
    Nay, brother.  The voice was: "The end is sorrow!"

                     THESEUS.
    Ye heard not, O dull-witted!  Unto me
    (Alone of all ye wise) the great voice came,
    "The Gates of Hell shall not in all prevail."

                     CASTOR.
    I heard, "Regret not thy mortality!
    Love conquers death!"

                     POLLUX.
                        But I, "Regret not thou
    Thine immortality!  Love conquers life!"<<1>>

<<1. Pollux being immortal, and Caster mortal, at the former's request Zeus allowed them to pool their fates, and live alternate days in Hades and Olympus.>>

                     ORPHEUS.
    A partial wisdom to a partial ear.

                      JASON.
    But what speech came to thee?

                     ORPHEUS.
                             I heard no voice.

                      ARGUS.
    What means the?  Here's my labour thrown away,
    My skill made jest of, all my wage destroyed
    At one fell stroke.

                      JASON.
                    What?  Is the Argo burnt?  {97A}

                      ARGUS.
    Burnt!  Should I then complain?  The ship is finished.

                      JASON.
    The Goddess, furious at thine absence, Argus,
    Hath frenzied thee with some delusion.

                    HERACLES.
                                        Calm!
    Control thy madness!  I am sorry now
    My pungent wit so shamed his arrogance
    As made him seem to scorn Athena.

                      ARGUS.
                                       Thou!
    But see me, I am ruined.  The good ship
    Is finished!  Where's my daily wage?

                      JASON.
                                     Be sure
    I pay thee treble if thy tale be true.

                      ARGUS.
    Ay! treble nothing!  I shall buy a palace.

                      JASON.
    Treble thine utmost wish.

                      ARGUS.
                              Two evils then
    Thou pilest on one good!  But come and see!
                           ["The Argo is discovered."

                CHORUS OF HEROES.

      By wisdom framed from ancient days
        The stately Argo stands above;
      Too firm to fear, too great to praise,
        The might of bright Athena's love!
      Oh! ship of glory! tread the foam,
      And bring our guerdon from its home!  {97B}

      The silent thought, the hand unseen,
        The rayless majesty of light
      Shed from the splendour of our Queen
        Athena! mystery and might;
      These worked invisibly to bring
      The end of triumph to our King.

      Great Jason, wronged by hate of man,
        Shall pass the portals of the deep;
      Shall seek the waters wide and wan;
        Shall pass within the land of sleep;
      And there the guardians of the soil
      Shall rest at last from pain and toil.

      O ruler of the empyrean,
        Behold his fervour conquering
      The fury of the breed Cadmean,
        The dragons of the Theban king;
      And armed men shall spring from earth
      In vain to ward the gloomy girth!

      But thou, Athena, didst devise
        Some end beyond our mortal ken,
      Thy soul impenetrably wise
        Shines not to us unthinking men.
      O guard the warrior band of Greece,
      And win for us the Golden Fleece!

      By miracle this happy day
        The ship is finished for our quest.
      Bring thou the glory from the gray!
        Bring thou our spirits into rest!
      O Wisdom, that hast helped so far,
      Sink never thou thy guiding star!

                CHORUS OF WORKMEN.

      Then let us gather one and all,
        And launch our dragon on the main
      With paeans raised most musical,
        Until our heroes come again.
      With watching and with prayer we wait
      The imperious Destinies of Fate!

        AEETES, JASON, MEDEA, Messengers,
                "Chorus of" Heroes.

          SCENE:  "The Palace of "AEETES.

                     AEETES.
    Were this man son of Zeus, beloved of Heaven,
    And skilled with very craft of Maia's son,
    Stronger than Phoebus, subtler than the Sphinx,
    This plague should catch him, nor my wisdom spare.

                CHORUS OF HEROES.
    Thus hast thou sent him unto Hades, king.

                     AEETES.
    Not otherwise were such gain possible.
    Ye are the witnesses that with much skill,
    And eloquence of shining words, and thought
    Darkling behind their measured melody,
    I did dissuade him.

                     CHORUS.
                       Such an enterprise
    After such toils no man should lightly leave.
    Remember all the tasks impossible
    This hero hath already done, before
    He ever touched this sounding coast of thine.

                     AEETES.
    Alas! but now his weird is loneliness!

                     CHORUS.
    Was that from Destiny, or will of thine?  {98B}

                     AEETES.
    I love him little.  Yet my words were true,
    Nor would it skill him aught if myriad men
    Bucklered his back and breast.  For when a man
    Batters with sword-hilt at the frowning gates
    That lead to the Beyond, not human force --
    Hardly the favour of the gods themselves --
    Shall stead him in that peril.

                     CHORUS.
                               Yet we know
    Courage may conquer all things.

                     AEETES.
                                Such a man
    Is greater than the gods!

                     CHORUS.
                              If only he
    Know who he is -- that all these gods and men
    And things are but the shadows of himself!

                     AEETES.
    I cannot give you hope.  Await the end.

                     CHORUS.
        We fear indeed that in the trap
          Of wiles our king is taken.
        Lachesis shakes a careless lap
          And dooms divine awaken!
        A desolate and cruel hap
          In this sad hour is shaken.

        The desperate son and violent
          Of Helios hath designed
        A fate more hard than Pelias meant,
          Revolving in his mind
        Mischief to catch the coiled ascent
          Of groaning humankind.

        O bright Athena, hitherto
          Protectress of the quest,
        Divide the deep descending blue!
           Be present, ever-blest!
        Bring thou the hero Jason through
           To victory -- and rest!  {99A}

                      MEDEA.
    Not by Athena's calm omnipotence,
    O heroes, look for safety!  Little men,
    Looking to God, are blinded; mighty ones,
    Seeking His presence, reel before the glance;
    And They, the greatest that may be of men,
    Become that light, and care no whit for earth.
    But all your prayers are answered by yourselves,
    As I myself achieve this thought of mine.

                     CHORUS.
    To me thou seemest to blaspheme the gods.

                      MEDEA.
    Belike I seem, O ye of little wit.

                     CHORUS.
    Surely thy tender years and gentle looks
    Belie such hatred to our king!  I scorn
    To triumph on an enemy once fallen.

                      MEDEA.
    Fools always!  I am tenderer than my years,
    And gentler than my glances.

                     CHORUS.
                            Sayst thou -- what?

                      MEDEA.
    Ye know me a most powerful sorceress.

                     CHORUS.
    So I have heard, O lotus-footed<<1>> one!
    Nathless I see not any miracle.

<<1. An epithet common in the East, conveying a great compliment.>>

                      MEDEA.
    Last night the heavy-hearted audience
    Broke up, and Jason wended wearily
    His way, oppressed by direful bodements of
    The fate of this forenoon.  I saw him go
    Sad, and remembered how sublime he stood,  {99B}
    Bronzed with a ruder sun than ours, and scarred
    (Rough tokens of old battles) yet so calm
    And mild (with all that vigour) that to me
    Came a swift pity -- the enchanter's bane.
    That I flung from me.  But my subtle soul
    Struck its own bosom with the sword of thought,
    So that I saw not pity, but desire!

                     CHORUS.
    Surely a bane more potent than the first.

                      MEDEA.
    Love is itself enchantment!

                     CHORUS.
                                     Some kind god
    Whispers from this a little light of hope.

                      MEDEA.
    Only the hopeless are the happy ones.<<1>>

<<1. "The hopeless are happy, like the girl Pingala" (Buddhist Proverb).  Pingala waited for her lover, and mourned because he came not.  But, giving up hope at last, she regained her cheerfulness.  "Cf." 2 Samuel xii, 15-23.>>

                     CHORUS.
    But didst thou turn him from his gleaming goal?
    Cover that shame with sweeter shame than this?

                      MEDEA.
    Thou knowest that his vigil was to keep,
    Invoking all Olympus all the night,
    And then to joke the oxen, and to plough
    The fearful furrow, sow the dreadful seed,
    Smite down the armies, and assuage the pest
    Of slime thrice coiled about the sacred grove.

                     CHORUS.
    Thy bitter love disturbed that solitude?

                      MEDEA.
    Not bitter, heroes.  See ye yet the end?  {100A}

                     CHORUS.
    Our good quest ended by thy father's hate,
    And by thy own hour's madness!  This I see.

                      MEDEA.
    But if he gain the Fleece?

                     CHORUS.
                                   A blissful end.

                      MEDEA.
    This end and that are moulded diversely.

                     CHORUS.
    Riddle no more, nor ply with doubtful hope
    Hearts ready to rejoice and to despair
    Equally minded.

                      MEDEA.
                    At the midmost hour,
    His mind given up to sleepless muttering
    Of charms not mine -- decrees Olympian --
    All on a sudden he felt fervent arms
    Flung round him, and a hot sweet body's rush
    Lithe to embrace him, and a cataract
    Of amber-scented hair hissing about
    His head, and in the darkness two great eyes
    Flaming above him, and the whole face filled
    With fire and shapen as kisses.  And those arms
    And kisses and mad movements of quick love
    Burnt up his being, and his life was lost
    In woman's love at last!

                     CHORUS.
                               Unseemly act!
    Who dared thus break on meditation?

                      MEDEA.
                                         I.

                     CHORUS.
    Surely thy passion mastered thee, O queen!  {100B}

                      MEDEA.
    I tell you -- thus the night passed.

                     CHORUS.
                                     Verily,
    The woman raves.

                      MEDEA.
                      Such victory as this
    Outsails all shame.  before the dawn was up
    I bound such talismans about his breast
    That fire and steel grow dew and flowery wreaths
    For all their power to hurt him.  Presently
    I made a posset, drugged with somnolence,
    Sleepy with poppy and white hellebore,
    Fit for the dragon.  This was my design.

                     CHORUS.
    Beware thy father's anger when he finds
    His plans thus baffled!  He will murder us.

                      MEDEA.
    Heroes indeed ye are, and lion hearts.

                     CHORUS.
    No woman need school me in bravery.

                      MEDEA.
    Rather a hare.

                     CHORUS.
                Most impudent of whores!

                      MEDEA.
    But when my husband comes victorious
    Fleece-laden, he will rather --

                     CHORUS.
                               Wilt thou then
    Further my ruin, making known this shame!

                      MEDEA.
    Here is the Argive sense of gratitude.
    Let me stir up its subtler thought, and show
    What favours ye may gather afterward
    From hands and lips ye scorn -- not courteously.  {101A}

                     CHORUS.
    What?  Canst thou save us from this newer doom?

                      MEDEA.
    I love your leader with no mortal love,
    But with the whole strength of a sorceress.

                     CHORUS.
    It seems indeed thy hot will can bewitch
    Our chaste one with one action impudent.

                      MEDEA.
    I will not leave him ever in the world.

                     CHORUS.
    Persistence in these ills -- will cure them not.
    "Worst" is the hunter, "worse" the hound, when "bad"
    Is the stag's name.

                      MEDEA.
                        We rule Iolchus' land.

                     CHORUS.
    Indeed the hunter follows.  I despise
    Lewd conduct in the lowest, and detest
    Spells hurtful to the head, when ancient hags
    Brew their bad liquors at the waning moon,
    Barking their chants of murder.  But to rule
    A land, and wive a king, and bread to him
    Kings -- then such persons are unsuitable.

                      MEDEA.
    Unless these words were well repented of
    I might transform ye into - --

                     CHORUS.
                         Stay, great queen!

                      MEDEA.
    Well for your respite comes this messenger.  {101B}

                    MESSENGER.
    Queen and fair mother of great kings unborn,
    And mighty chosen of the land of Greece,
    A tiding of deep bliss is born to you.

                     CHORUS.
    Tell me that Jason has achieved the quest.

                    MESSENGER.
    Truth is no handmaid unto happiness.

                     CHORUS.
    What terror dost thou fill my heart withal?

                      MEDEA.
    O timorous heroes!  Let the herald speak!
    Who meets fear drives her back; who flees from fear
    Stumbles; who cares not, sees her not.
        Speak on!

                  THE MESSENGER.
    Terrible bellowings as of angry bulls
    Broke from the stable as the first swift shaft
    Of dawn smote into it: and stampings fierce
    Resounded, shaking the all-mother earth.
    Whereunto came the calm and kingly man,
    Smiling as if a sweet dream still beguiled
    His waking brows; not caring any more
    For spring or summer; heeding least of all
    That tumult of ox-fury.  Suddenly
    A light sprang in his face; the great hand shot
    Forth, and broke in the brass-bound door; the day
    Passed with him inwards; then the brazen hoofs
    Beat with a tenfold fury on the stone.
    But Jason, swiftly turned, evaded these,
    And chose two oxen from that monstrous herd
    To whose vast heads he strode, and by the horns
    Plucked them.  Then fire, devouring, sprang at him
    From furious nostrils: and indignant breath,
    Fountains of seething smoke, spat forth at him.  {102A}
    But with no tremor of aught that seemed like fear
    Drew them by sheer strength from their place, and joked
    Their frenzy to his plough, and with the goad
    Urged them, thrice trampling the accursed field
    Until the furrows flamed across the sun,
    Treading whose glory stood Apollo's self
    As witness of the deed.  Then at last thrust
    Savage, drove them less savage to their stalls,
    And Jason turned and laughed.  Then drew he out
    The dreadful teeth of woe, Cadmean stock
    Of Thebes' old misery, and presently
    Pacing the furrowed field, he scattered them
    With muttered words of power athwart the course
    Of the bright moon, due path of pestilence
    And terror.  Ere the last bone fell to earth
    The accursed harvest sprang to life.  Armed men,
    Fiery with anger, rose upon the earth
    While Jason stood, one witnessing a dream,
    Not one who lives his life.  The sword and spear
    Turn not to him, but mutual madness strikes
    The warriors witless, and fierce wrath invades
    Their hearts of fury, and with arms engaged
    They fell upon each other silently
    And slew, and slew.  As in the middle seas
    A mirage flashes out and passes, so
    The phantoms faded, and the way was clear.
    Thus, stepping ever proud and calm, he went
    Unto the grove of Ares, where the worm,
    Huge in his hatred, guarded all.  But now
    Sunk in some stupor, surely sent of Zeus,
    He stirred not.  Stepping delicately past
    The dragon, then came Jason to the grove
    And saw what tree umbrageous bore the fruit
    That he had saddened for so long.  And he,
    Rending the branches of that wizard Oak,
    With a strong grasp tore down the Fleece of Gold.
    Then came a voice: "Woe, woe!  Aea's isle!
    Thy glory is departed!"  And a voice
    Answered it "Woe!"  Then Jason seemed to see
    Some Fear behind the little former fears;  {102B}
    And his face blanched a moment, as beholding
    Some Fate, some distant grief.  Then, catching sight
    Now of the glory of his gain, he seemed
    Caught in an ecstasy, treading the earth
    As in a brighter dream than Aphrodite
    Sent ever to a man, he turned himself
    (We could not see him for the golden flame
    Burning about him!) moving hitherward.
    But I took horse and hasted, since reward
    May greet such tidings, and for joy to see
    Your joy exceed my joy.

                      MEDEA.
                             Reward indeed
    Awaits thee from such folk as us, who stand
    In fear of life, when great Aeetes hears
    This news, and how all came.

                    MESSENGER.
                               My lady's smile
    Is the reward I sought, not place nor gold.

                      MEDEA.
    Thou hast it, child.

                SECOND MESSENGER.
                       The hero is at hand.

                     CHORUS.
             O happy of mortals!
               O fronter of fear,
             The impassable portals!
    Our song shall be rolled in the praise of the gold, and its glory be told
        where the heavenly fold rejoices to hold the stars in its sphere.

             O hero Iolchian!
               Warrior king!
             From the kingdom Colchian
               The Fleece dost bring!
    Our song shall be sung and its melody flung where the Lure and the Tongue
        are fervid and young, all islands among where the Sirens sing.  {103A}

             Thou bearest, strong shoulder,
               The sunbright fleece!
             Glow swifter and bolder
               And brighter -- and cease!
    O glory of light!  O woven of night!  O shining and bright!  O dream of
        delight!  How splendid the sight for the dwellers of Greece!

             Gained is the guerdon!
               The prize is won.
             The fleecy burden,
               The soul of the sun!
    The toil is over; the days discover high joys that hover of lover and
        lover, and fates above her are fallen and done.


                      JASON.
    Queen of this people!  O my heart's desire
    Spotless, the Lady of my love, and friends
    By whose heroic arduous I am found
    Victor at last, well girded with the spoil
    Of life in gleaming beauty, and this prize
    Thrice precious, my Medea -- all is won!
    Needs only now the favouring kiss of Eurus,
    Bright-born of Eos, to fulfil for us
    The last of all the labours, to inspire
    The quick-raised sail, and fill that flushing gold
    With thrice desired breath, that once again
    Our prow plunge solemn in the Argive waters
    To strains of music -- victory at peace
    Mingling with sweeter epithalamy --
    To tell our friends how happy was the quest.

                      MEDEA.
    But not those strains of music, though divine
    From Orpheus' winged lyre, exalt at all
    Our joy to joy, beyond all music's power!

                     CHORUS.
    I fear Aeetes, and the Pelian guile.

                      JASON.
    Fear is but failure, hearld of distress!

                      MEDEA.
    What virtue lives there in the coward's hrate?  {103B}

                     CHORUS.
    In sooth, I have no fear at all -- to flee.

                      JASON.
    Night, like a mist, steals softly from the East.
    the hand of darkness gathers up the folds
    Of day's gold garment, and the valleys sink
    Into slow sadness, thought the hills retain
    That brilliance for a little.

                     CHORUS.
                                  Let us go!
    Methinks that under cover of the night
    I may escape Aeetes.

                      JASON.
                         If he chase,
    Our Argo is not battered by rough winds
    So far but what some fight were possible

        MEDEA.  ["Leads forward" ABSYRTUS.]
    I know a better way than that, my lord.
    This boy shall come with us.

                                  What is this?
    Thou hintest at some dangerous destiny.

    Come love, to the long years of love with me!

    Form, heroes, and in solemn order stride;
    The body-guardians of the Golden Fleece!

    Guarding your king and queen on every side --  {104A}

                 SCENE: "The Argo."

    Ay!  I would murder not my brother only,
    But tear my own limbs, strew them on the sea,<<1>>
    To keep one fury from the man I love!

<<1. The Argonauts being pursued by Aeetes, Medea threw the severed limbs and trunk of Absyrtus upon the sea, so that the father, stopping to perform the sacred duties of burial, was left behind.>>

    This act and speech are much akin to madness.

    Remember that your own skins pay the price.

                     CHORUS.
    I now remember somewhat of the voice
    Of the oracle, that Madness should hunt hard
    On the thief's furtive track, upon the prow
    Brooding, and at the table president,
    And spouse-like in the bed.  {104B}

                             But this is like
    That Indian fable<<1>> of a king: how he,
    Taking some woman -- an indecent act
    Not proper to be done! -- against the will
    Of priests or princes, sought the nuptial bed
    And
      "Climbed the bed's disastrous side,
       He found a serpent, not a bride;
       And scarcely daring to draw breath,
       He passed the dumb night-hours with death,
       Till in the morning cold and gray
       The hooded fear glided away.
       Which morning saw ten thousand pay
       The price of jesting with a king!" --

    Indeed these toils and dangerous pursuits,
    Labours and journeys, go to make one mad.
    Well were it to beguile our weariness
    With song.

                      MEDEA.
                  And here is the sole king of song.

                     ORPHEUS.
    My song breaks baffled on the rocks of time
    If thy bewitching beauty be the theme.

                      MEDEA.
    Sing me thy song, sweet poet, of the sea,
    That song of swimming when thy love lost sense
    Before the passion of the Infinite.

                      JASON.
    The more so as my master warns me oft
    Of late how near that island is, where dwell
    The alluring daughters of Melpomene.  {105A}

                   ORPHEUS.<<1>>
    Light shed from seaward over breakers bending
        Kiss-wise to the emerald hollows; light divine
        Whereof the sun is God, the sea his shrine;
    Light in vibrations rhythmic; light unending;
        Light sideways from the girdling crags extending
        Unto this lone and languid head of mine;
        Light, that fulfils creation as with wine,
    Flows in the channels of the deep: light, rending
        The adamantine columns of the night.
        Is laden with the love-song of the light.

<<1. The song describes Waikiki Beach, near Honolulu.>>

    Light, pearly-glimmering through dim gulf and hollow,
        Below the foam-kissed lips of all the sea;
        Light shines from all the sky and up to me
    From the amber floors of sand: Light calls Apollo!
    The shafts of fire fledged of the eagle follow
        The crested surf, and strike the shore, and flee
        Far from green cover, nymph-enchanted lea,
    Fountain, and plume them white as the sea-swallow,
        And turn and quiver in the ocean, seeming
        The glances of a maiden kissed, or dreaming.

    Light, as I swim through rollers green and gleaming,
        Sheds its most subtle sense to penetrate
        This heart I thought impervious to Fate.
    Now the sweet light, the full delight, is beaming  {105B}
    Through me and burns me: all my flesh is teeming
        With the live kisses of the sea, my mate,
        My mistress, till the fires of life abate
    And live me languid, man-forgotten, deeming
        I see in sleep, in many-coloured night,
        More hope than in the flame-waves of the light.

    Light! ever light!  I swim far out and follow
        The footsteps of the wind, and light invades
        My desolate soul, and all the cypress shades
    Glow with transparent lustre, and the hollow
    I thought I had hidden in my heart must swallow
        The bitter draught of Truth; no Nereid maids
        Even in my sea are mine; the whole sea's glades
    And hills and springs are void of my Apollo --
        The Sea herself my tune and my desire!
        The Sun himself my lover and my lyre!

                     CHORUS.
    This song is sweeter than the honeycomb.

                      MEDEA.
    Nearly as sweet as good friends quarrelling.

                      JASON.
    Look, friends, methinks I see a silvern shape
    Like faint mist floating on the farthest sea.

                      MEDEA.
    I see a barren rock above the tides.

                      JASON.
    I hear a sound like water whispering.

                      MEDEA.
    I hear a harsh noise like some ancient crone
    Muttering curses.  {106A}

                      JASON.
                      Now I hear a song.
    'Tis like some shape of sleep that moans for joy,
    Some bridal sob of love!

                      MEDEA.
                                O Son of God!
    My poet, swiftly leap the live lyre forth!
    Else we are all enchanted -- yet to me
    This song is nowise lovely.  But in him
    I note the live look of the eyes leap up,
    And all his love for me forgotten straight
    At the mere echo of that tune.

                     ORPHEUS.
                                 Hark, friends!
    Aea's tune -- my Colchian harbour-song!<<1>>

<<1. The harbour in which this lyric was written was that of Vera Cruz.>>

      I hear the waters faint and far,
      And look to where the Polar Star,
      Half hidden in the haze, divides
      The double chanting of the tides;
      But, where the harbour's gloomy mouth
      Welcomes the stranger to the south,
      The water shakes, and all the sea
      Grows silver suddenly.

      As one who standing on the moon
      Sees the vast horns in silver hewn,
      Himself in darkness, and beholds
      How silently all space unfolds
      Into her shapeless breast the spark
      And sacred phantom of the dark;
      So in the harbour-horns I stand
      Till I forget the land.

      Who sails through all that solemn space
      Out to the twilight's secret place,
      The sleepy waters move below
      His ship's imaginary flow.
      No song, no lute, so lowly chaunts
      In woods where still Arsibe haunts,
      Wrapping the wanderer with her tresses
      Into untold carresses.  {106B}

      For none of all the sons of men
      That hath known Artemis, again
      Turns to the warmer earth, or vows
      His secrets to another spouse.
      The moon resolves her beauty in
      The sea's deep kisses salt and keen;
      The sea assumes the lunar light,
      And he -- their eremite!

      In their calm intercourse and kiss
      Even hell itself no longer is;
      For nothing in their love abides
      That passes not beneath their tides,
      And whoso bathes in light of theirs,
      And water, changes unawares
      To be no separate soul, but be
      Himself the moon and sea.

      Not all the wealth that flowers shed,
      And sacred streams, on that calm head;
      Not all the earth's spell-weaving dream
      And scent of new-turned earth shall seem
      Again indeed his mother's breast
      To breathe like sleep and give him rest;
      He lives or dies in subtler swoon
      Beneath the sea and moon.

      So standing, gliding, undeterred
      By any her alluring word
      That calls from older forest glades,
      My soul forgets the gentle maids
      That wooed me in the scarlet bowers,
      And golden cluster-woof of flowers;
      Forgets itself, content to be
      Between the moon and sea.

      No passion stirs their depth, nor moves;
      No life distrubs their sweet dead loves;
      No being holds a crown or throne;
      They are, and I in them, alone:
      Only some lute-player grown star
      Is heard like whispering flowers afar;
      And some divided, single tune
      Sobs from the sea and moon.

      Amid thy mountains shall I rise,
      O moon, and float about thy skies?
      Beneath thy waters shall I roam,
      O sea, and call thy valleys home?  {107A}
      Or on Daedalian oarage fare
      Forth in the interlunar air?
      Imageless mirror-life! to be
      sole between moon and sea.

                     CHORUS.
    No song can lure us while he signs so well.

                      JASON.
    But look!  I see entrancing woman-forms
    That beckon -- fairy-like and not of earth.
    So, fitter than the bed of this my queen
    To rest heroic limbs!

                      MEDEA.
                          The wretched one!
    Thou knowest that their kiss is death!

                      JASON.
                                    Perhaps.
    It were their kiss.

                      MEDEA.
                      Are not my kisses sweet?

                      JASON.
    Listen, they sing.  This time the words ring true,
    Sailing across that blue abyss between.
    Like young birds winging their bright flight the notes
    Glimmer across the sea.

                      MEDEA.
                        They sing, they sing!

                   PARTHENOPE.
      O mortal, tossed on life's unceasing ocean,
        Whose waves of joy and sorrow never cease,
      Eternal change -- one changeless thing, commotion!
        Even in death no hint of calm and peace! --  {107B}
      Here is the charm, the life-assuaging potion,
        Here is a better home for thee than Greece!
      Come, love, to my deep, soft, sleepy breast!
            Here is thy rest!

      O mortal, said is life!  But in my kisses
        Thou may'st forget its fever-parched thirst.
      Age, death, and sorrow fade in slender blisses:
        My swoon of love drinks up the draught accurst.
      And all thy seasons grow as sweet as this is,
        One constant summer in sleep's bosom nursed.
      All storm and sunlight, star and season, cease,
            Here is thy peace.

      O mortal, sad is love!  But my dominion
        Extends beyond love's ultimate abode.
      Eternity itself is but a minion,
        Lighting my way on the untravelled road.
      Gods shelter 'neath one shadow of my pinion.
        Thou only tread the path none else hath trode!
      Come, lover, in my breast all blooms above,
            Here is thy love!

                      MEDEA.
    My poet, now!  The one song in the world!

                     ORPHEUS.
        Above us on the mast is spread
          The splendour of the fleece!
        Before us, Argive maidens tread
          The glowing isles of Greece!
        Behind us, fear and toil are dead:
          Below, the breakers cease!
        The Holy Light is on my head --
          My very name is Peace!  {108A}

        The water's music moves; and swings
          The sea's eternal breast.
        The wind above us whistles, rings,
          And wafts us to the West.
        Greece lures us on with beckonings
          And sighs of slumber blest.
        I am not counted with the kings --
          My very name is Rest!

        Medea shoots her sweetest glance
          And Jason bends above --
        Young virgins in Iolchus dance,
          Hearing the news thereof.
        The heroes -- see their glad advance!
          Hath Greece not maids enough?
        I lie in love's ecstatic trance.
          My very name is love!

                      LIGIA.
      Come over the water, love, to me!
          Come over the little space!
      Come over, my lover, and thou shalt see
          The beauty of my face!
      Come over the water!  I will be
      A bride and a queen and a lover to thee!

      Come over the water, love, and lie!
        All day and all night to kiss!
      Come over, my lover, an hour to die
        In the language-baffling bliss!
      Come over the water!  Must I sigh?
      Thy lover and bride and queen am I!

      Come over the water, love, and bide
        An hour in my swift caress!
      So short is the space, and so smooth the tide --
        More smooth is my loveliness!
      Come over the water, love, to my side!
      I am thy lover and queen and bride!

                      MEDEA.
    Sing, poet, ere the rash fool leap!

                      JASON.
                              Ah, Zeus!  {108B}

                     ORPHEUS.
      The hearts of Greeks with sharper flames
        Burn than with one fire of all fire,
      We have the Races and the Games,
        The song, the chisel, and the lyre;
      We have the altar, we the shrine,
      And ours the joy of love and wine.

      Why take one pleasure, put aside
        The myriad bliss of life diverse?
      Unchanging joy will soon divide
        Into the likeness of a curse.
      Have we no maidens, slender, strong,
      Daughters of tender-throated song?

      I swear by Aphrodite's eyes
        Our Grecian maids are fairer far!
      What love as sweet as their is lies
        In Sun or planet, moon or star?
      What nymphs as sweet as ours are dwell
      By foreign grove and alien well?

      With every watchman's cheery cry,
        "Land ho!" through all the journeying years
      Our ever-hoping hearts reply,
        "A land of bliss at last appears."
      But what land laps a foreign foam
      So sweet as is the hero's home?

      At every port the novel sights
        Charm for an hour -- delusive bliss.
      On every shore the false delights
        Of maidens ply the barbarous kiss.
      But where did hero think to stay
      Lulled in their love beyond a day?

      No shoreland whistles to the wind
        So musically as Thrace: no town
      So gladdens the toil-weary mind
        As brave Athenae: no renown
      Stands so divine in war and peace
      As the illustrious name of Greece.  {109A}

      This island of the subtle song
        Shall vanish as the shaken spray
      Tossed by the billow far and strong
        On marble coasts: we will not stay!
      Dreams lure not those who ply the sail
      Before, the home! behind, the gale!

                      JASON.
    Ah!  I am torn, I am torn!

                      MEDEA.
                              God's poet, hail!
    Help us, Apollo!  Light of Sun, awake!
    This is the desperate hour.

                      JASON.
                           I have no strength.

                      MEDEA.
    Beware the third, the awful ecstasy!

                     ORPHEUS.
    A higher spell controls a lower song.
    Listen, they sing!

                      JASON.
                Joy!  Joy! they sing, they sing!

                    LEUCOSIA.
      O love, I am lonely here!
        O love, I am weeping!
      Each pearl of ocean is a tear
        Let fall while love was sleeping.

      A tear is made of fire and dew
        And saddened with a smile;
      The sun's laugh in the curving blue
        Lasts but a little while.

      The night-winds kiss the deep: the stars
        Shed laughter from above;
      But night must pass dawn's prison bars:
        Night hath not tasted love.  {109B}

      With me the night is fallen in day;
        The day swoons back to night;
      The white and black are woven in gray,
        Faint sleep of silken light.

      A strange soft light about me shed
        Devours the sense of time:
      Hovers about my sleepy head
        Some sweet persistent rhyme.

      Beneath my breast my love may hear
        Deep murmur of the billows --
      O gather me to thee, my dear,
        On soft forgetful pillows!

      O gather me in arms of love
        As maidens plucking posies,
      Or mists that fold about a dove,
        Or valleys full of roses!

      O let me fade and fall away
        From waking into sleep,
      From sleep to death, from gold to gray,
        Deep as the skies are deep!

      O let me fall from death to dream,
        Eternal monotone;
      Faint eventide of sleep supreme
        With thee and love alone!

      A jewelled night of star and moon
        Shall watch our bridal chamber,
      Bending the blue rays to the tune
        Of softly-sliding amber.

      Dim winds shall whisper echoes of
        Our slow ecstatic breath,
      Telling all worlds how sweet is love,
        How beautiful is death.

                      MEDEA.
    Sing, Orpheus, this doth madden them the most.
    Should one man leap -- This tune is terrible!

                     ORPHEUS.
    I am not moved, although I am a man.
    So strong a safeguard is cool chastity.  {110A}

                      MEDEA.
    But love thou me!  My husband is distraught.

                     ORPHEUS.
    Madness is on him for thy punishment.

                      MEDEA.
    Sing, therefore!

                This last song of theirs was sweet.

                      MEDEA.
    Thine therefore should be sweeter.

                     ORPHEUS.
                          The Gods grant it!

      Lift up this love of peace and bliss,
        The starry soul of wine,
      Destruction's formidable kiss,
        The lamp of the divine;
      This shadow of a nobler name
      Whose life is strife, whose soul is fame!

       I rather will exalt the soul
        Of man to loftier height,
      And kindle at a livelier coal
        The subtler soul of Light.
      From these soft splendours of a dream
      I turn, and seek the Self supreme.

      This world is shadow-shapen of
        The bitterness of pain.
      Vain are the little lamps of love!
        The light of life is vain!
      Life, death, joy, sorrow, age and youth
      Are phantoms of a further truth.

      Beyond the splendour of the world,<<1>>
        False glittering of the gold,
      A Serpent is in slumber curled
        In wisdom's sacred cold.
      Life is the flaming of that flame.
      Death is the naming of that name.  {110B}

<<1. The theory of these verses is that of certain esoteric schools among the Hindus.>>

      The forehead of the snake is bright
        With one immortal star,
      Lighting her coils with living light
        To where the nenuphar
      Sleeps for her couch.  All darkness dreams
      The thing that is not, only seems.

      That star upon the serpent's head
        Is called the soul of man;
      That light in shadows subtly shed
        The glamour of life's plan.
      The sea whereon that lotus grows
      Is thought's abyss of tears and woes.

      Leave Sirenusa!  Even Greece
        Forget! they are not there!
      By worship cometh not the Peace,
        The Silence not by prayer!
      Leave the illusions, life and time
      And death, and seek that star sublime --

      Until the lotus and the sea
        And snake no longer are,
      And single through eternity
        Exists alone the Star,
      And utter Knowledge rise and cease
      In that which is beyond the Peace!

                      JASON.
    Those isles have faded: was this vision true?

                    HERACLES.
    I know not what hath passed: I seem asleep
    Still, with the dream yet racing in my brain.

                     THESEUS.
    There was a sweetness: whether sight or song
    I know not.

                      JASON.
            But my veins grew strong and swollen
    And madness came upon me.

                      MEDEA.
                               You are here,
    Let that suffice.  Remember not!  {111B}

                     ORPHEUS.
                                But now
    I see the haze lift on the water-way,
    And hidden headlands loom again.

                      JASON.
                                        I know
    The pleasant portals.

                     CHORUS.
                          Here is home at last.

                     ORPHEUS.
    The sunset comes: the mist is lifted now
    To let the last kiss of the daylight fall
    Once ere night whisper "Sleep!"

                      JASON.
                            And see! the ship
    Glides between walls of purple.

                      MEDEA.
                                  The green land
    Cools the tired eyes.

                     CHORUS.
                        The rocks stand sentinel.

                      MEDEA.
    Let still the song that saved us gladden us.
    Lift up thy lyre, sweet Orpheus, on the sea.

                   ORPHEUS.<<1>>
      Over a sea like stained glass
      At sunset like chrysopras: --
          Our smooth-oared vessel over-rides
          Crimson and green and purple tides.
      Between the rocky isles we pass,
      And greener islets gay with grass;
          Between the over-arching sides
                  Our pinnace glides.  {111B}

<<1. The song describes the approach to Hong Kong Harbour.>>

      Just by the Maenad-haunted hill
      Songs rise into the air, and thrill,
          Like clustered birds at evening
          When love outlingers rain and spring.
      Faint faces of strange dancers spill
      Their dewy scent; and sweet and chill
          The wind comes faintly whispering
                  On wanton wing.

      Between the islands sheer and steep
      Our craft treads noiseless o'er the deep,
          Turned to the gold heart of the west,
          The sun's last sigh of love expressed
      Ere the lake glimmer, borrow sleep
      From clouds and tinge their edges; weep
          That night brings love not to his breast,
                  But only rest.

      We move toward the golden track
      Shed in the water: we look back
          Eastward, where rose is set to warn
          Promise and prophecy of dawn
      Reflected, lest the ocean lack
      In any space serene or slack
          Some colour, blushing o'er the fawn
                  Dim-lighted lawn.

      And under all the shadowy shapes
      Of steep and silent bays and capes
          The water takes its darkest hue;
          Catches no laughter from the blue;
      No purple ray or gold escapes,
      But dim green shadow comes and drapes
          Its lustre: thus the night burns through
                  Tall groves of yew.

    Thither, ah thither!  Hollow vales
      Trembling with early nightingales!
          Languish, O sea of sleep!  Young moon!
          Dream on above in maiden swoon!
      None daring to invoke the gales
      To shake our sea, and swell our sails.
          Not song, but silence, were a boon --
                  Save for this tune.

      Round capes grown darker as night falls,
      We see at last the splendid walls
          That ridge the bay; the town lies there
          Lighted (the temple's hour for prayer)  {112A}
      At grave harmonious intervals.
      The grand voice of some seaman calls,
          Just as the picture fades, aware
                  How it was fair.

                      JASON.
    A thousand victories bring us to the shore
    Whence we set out: look forth!  The people come
    Moving with lights about the anchorage
    To greet the heroes of the Golden Fleece.
    My Queen!  Medea!  Welcome unto Greece!

    JASON, MEDEA, PELIAS, ACASTUS, ALCESTIS "and her" Sisters, MADNESS

          SCENE: "The Palace at Iolchus."

                     MADNESS.
        Black Ares hath called
          Me forth from the deep!
        Blind and appalled,
        Shall the palace high-walled
          Shake as I leap
        Over the granite,
          The marble over,
        One step to span it,
          One flight to hover,
        Like a moon round a planet,
          A dream round a lover!  {112B}

        How shall I come?
          Shrieking and yelling?
        Or quiet and dumb
          To the heart of the dwelling?
        Silently striding,
          Whispering terror
          Into their ears;
        Watching, abiding,
          Madness and error,
          Brooder of fears!

        Thus will I bring
          Black Ares to honour,
        Draw the black sting
          Of the serpent upon her!
        How foolish to fight
          With the warrior God
        Who brings victory bright
          Or defeat with a nod,
        Who standeth to smite
          With a spear and a rod!
        Here is the woman,
          Thinking no evil,
        Wielding the human
          By might of a devil!
        But I will mock her
          With cunning design,
        In my malice lock her.
          The doom is divine!

                      MEDEA.
    Ai!  Ai!  This rankles sorely in my mind
    That Pelias should wander, free to slide
    His sidelong looks among our courtiers
    Ripe ever for some mischief.  Yet methinks
    There is a wandering other than this present --
    Say, by the Stygian waves, unburied corpse! --
    But, for the means?  It ill befits our power
    And grace -- my husband's honour -- to stretch forth
    The arm of murder o'er the head of age.
    But surely must be means ----

                     MADNESS.
                               The prophecy!  {113A}

                      MEDEA.
    Happy my thought be!  I have found it.  Ha!
    "Athena shall relent not till the king
    Shall die and live."  Vainly the prophet meant
    Mere transference of the crown.  I'll twist his saying
    To daze the children -- fools they are!  So mask
    Evil beneath the waxen face of Good,
    Trick out Calamity in robes of Luck --
    Come, children!  Is the sun bright?  And your eyes?

                    ALCESTIS.
    Dear queen, all's well with us.  Such happiness
    Crowds daylight -- even sleep seems sorrowful,
    Though bright with dainty dreams!

                  FIRST DANAID.
                            But you are sad!

                      MEDEA.
    I meditate the ancient prophecy.
    Thus a foreboding is upon my heart,
    Seeing some danger follow yet, o'erhang
    Our heads, poised gaily in incertitude!

                  SECOND DANAID.
    Nay, grieve not, dear Medea!  All men say
    The prophecy is well fulfilled.

                      MEDEA.
                                Ay me!
    "Until the king shall die and live again."

                    ALCESTIS.
    What means that?

                      MEDEA.
                       I have meditated long.

                  SECOND DANAID.
    To what sad end?   {113B}

                      MEDEA.
                       At the full end I see
    Allusion to my magic -- to that spell
    Whereby an old man may renew his youth.

                    ALCESTIS.
    Our father!

                      MEDEA.
              You have guessed aright, my child.
    Your father must abandon his old age
    And -- by my magic -- find sweet youth again!

                    DANAIDES.
    But this is very difficult to do.

                      MEDEA.
    For me such miracles are merely play,
    Serving to while away the idle hours
    While Jason hunts ----

                    ALCESTIS.
                     How grand it were to see
    Our aged father rival the strong youths
    In feats of great agility!

                      MEDEA.
                             Agreed!
    But surely you should work the charm yourselves.
    For children magic is a blithesome game!

                    DANAIDES.
    Dear lady! teach us how to say the spell!

                      MEDEA.
    Words must be aided by appalling deeds!

                    ALCESTIS.
    O!  O! you frighten us.

                      MEDEA.
                          Be brave, my child!
    I too passed through unutterable things!

                    ALCESTIS.
    Let me fetch father!  {114A}

                      MEDEA.
               Nay, consider first.
    would he consent?  The process is severe!

                    DANAIDES.
    We know the sire is not exactly brave,
    Though very wise and good.

                      MEDEA.
                               'Tis clear to me;
    Without his knowledge we must do the deed.

                    ALCESTIS.
    What is this "deed"?

                      MEDEA.
                        A caldron is prepared;
    And, having hewn your father limb from limb,
    We seethe him in a broth of magic herbs.

                    ALCESTIS.
    And then?

                      MEDEA.
                   The proper incantations said,
    There rises from the steam a youthful shape
    More godlike than like man.  And he will fall
    In kind embraces on his children's necks.

                    ALCESTIS.
    O queen, this process seems indeed severe.

                      MEDEA.
    Without his knowledge must the thing be done.

                    DANAIDES.
    This also seems to us no easy task.

                      MEDEA.
    He sleeps through noon, while others are abroad.

                    ALCESTIS.
    Let us make haste!  Dear queen, how good you are!  {114B}

                      MEDEA.
    One thing remember!  While you say the spell --
    Here is the parchment! -- let no thought arise
    In any of your minds!<<1>>

<<1. It is a common jest among the Hindus to play this trick on a pupil, "i.e.". to promise him magical power on condition that during a given ceremonial he abstains from thinking of a certain object ("e.g.", a horse).

    The charm is broken.

    Be brave, dear sisters, pluck your courage up!
    Easy this one condition!  All is safe.

                      MEDEA.
    Haste then!  Good luck attend you!  When the hunt
    Returns, how joyful ----  {115A}

                  FIRST DANAID.
                         Striding vigorous,
    The man renewed grasps Jason in embrace
    Worthy of Heracles.

                    ALCESTIS.
                   Thanks, thanks, dear queen!
    We go, we go!

                      MEDEA.
                    The Goddess be your speed!
    Thus will the danger pass!  That vicious fool
    Shall cease his plots against my best beloved.
    No taint of fell complicity shall touch
    My honour in this matter.  I will sleep
    Through the delicious hours of breezy noon,
    Lulled by sweet voices of my singing maids;
    Secure at least that no one will attempt
    To wreck my virtue or -- restore my youth!

                     CHORUS.
      O sleep of lazy love, be near
        In dreams to lift the veil,
      And silence from the shadowy sphere
      To conjure in our lady's ear! --
        The voices fall and fail;
      The light is lowered.  O dim sleep,
      Over her eyelids creep!

      The world of dreams is shapen fair
        Beyond a mortal's nod:
      A fragrant and a sunny air
      Smiles: a man's kisses vanish there,
        Grow kisses of a god;
      And in dreams' darkness subtly grows
      No Earth-flowered bloom of rose.

      O dreams of love and peace, draw nigh,
        Hover with shadowy wings!
      Let shining shapes of ecstasy
      Cover the frail blue veil of sky,
        And speak immortal things!
      Dream, lady, dream through summer noon,
      Lulled by the sleepy tune!  {115B}

      The sense is riven, and the soul
        Goes glimmering to the abode,
      Where aeons in one moment roll,
      And one thought shapes to its control
        Body's forgotten load.
      Our lady sleeps!  Our lady smiles
      In far Elysian isles!

                   FIRST WOMAN.
    Thrice Have I crept towards the bed, and thrice
    An unseen hand has caught the uplifted knife,
    A grinning face lurked out from the blank air
    Between me and that filthy sorceress.

                  SECOND WOMAN.
    Daily I poison the she-devil's drink,
    An nothing harms her!

                   THIRD WOMAN.
                     I have a toad whose breath
    Destroys all life ----

                     CHORUS.
                       Thou dealest in such arts?

                   THIRD WOMAN.
    Ay! for this hate's sake.  Are we sisters all
    Herein?

                     CHORUS.
                 True sisters!

                   THIRD WOMAN.
                           The familiar soul
    Sucks at her mouth -- She sickens not nor dies;
    More poisonous than he.

                   FIRST WOMAN.
                             Ah! beast of hell!
    What may avail us?

                  SECOND WOMAN.
                         Jason is quite lost
    In her black sorceries.  {116A}

                  FOURTH WOMAN.
                     Our chance gone!

                   FIRST WOMAN.
                                        Our life
    Degraded to her service.

                  SECOND WOMAN.
                            We, who are
    Born nobly, are become her minions.

                   THIRD WOMAN.
    Slaves, not handmaidens!

                    ALCESTIS.
                               Ototototoi!
    Ai Ai!  What misery!

                   FIRST WOMAN.
                See! the lady weeps!

                    ALCESTIS.
    Ai Ai! the black fiend, how he dogs my feet!
    The fatal day!  Ai!  Ai!

                     CHORUS.
                             What sorrow thus,
    Maiden, removes the feet of fortitude?

                    ALCESTIS.
    Who shall arouse him?

                     CHORUS.
                        Peace, our lady sleeps.

                    ALCESTIS.
    Ah me! but she must wake!  A black, black deed
    Hangs on the house.

                      MEDEA.
                     What meets my waking ear?
    Alcestis!  {116B}

                    ALCESTIS.
                Ah, dear queen, lament, lament!
    I am undone by my own --

                      MEDEA.
                             What! the work?

                    ALCESTIS.
    Alas!  Alas! the work!

                      MEDEA.
                             Thy father?

                    ALCESTIS.
                                  Slain!

                     CHORUS.
    Ai Ai! the old man slain!

                      MEDEA.
                             Ai Ai!

                    ALCESTIS.
                                     Ai Ai!

                      MEDEA.
    The strong spell broken?

                    ALCESTIS.
                        Nay, but thoughts arose,
    So many thoughts -- or ever I was ware --
    And he -- the caldron seethes --

                      MEDEA.
                                 He rises not?

                    ALCESTIS.
    Nought but moist smoke springs up.

                      MEDEA.
                                 Alas! for me!
    All is but lost.

                    ALCESTIS.
                     Canst thou do anything?  {117A}

                      MEDEA.
    Nothing.  Ai Ai!

                    ALCESTIS.
                         Ai Ai!

                     CHORUS.
                                 Ai Ai!  Ai Ai!

                      JASON.
    What!  Shall the hunter find his joy abroad,
    And sorrow in his house?

                      MEDEA.
                               Thy very hearth
    Polluted with the old man's blood!

                     ACASTUS.
                                    What blood?
    Answer me, woman!

                      MEDEA.
                     To thy knees, false hound,
    Fawning to snap!

                     ACASTUS.
                       What misery, pale slaves,
    Lament ye?

                     CHORUS.
                 Ah! the ill omen!  Ah, the day!
    Alcestis hath her sire in error slain.

                     ACASTUS.
    Sister!

                    ALCESTIS.
             O brother, bear thine anger back!

                     ACASTUS.
    Speak!

                    ALCESTIS.
          Ah, the prophecy!  Ai Ai!

                     CHORUS.
                                  Ai Ai!  {117B}

                     ACASTUS.
    What folly masks what wickedness?  Speak on!

                    ALCESTIS.
    I cannot speak.

                      JASON.
                     Speak thou, Medea!

                      MEDEA.
                                   The child
    Hath hewn her sire asunder, seething him
    In herbs of sacred power.

                     ACASTUS.
                             By thy decree?

                      MEDEA.
    Nay!

                     MADNESS.
            Safer is it to admit to these
    Fools -- charge the child with lack of fortune!

                      MEDEA.
                                       Yea!
    I bade her take a waxen shape, carved well
    To look like the old man ----

                    ALCESTIS.
                          Nay! nay! the Sire
    Himself we stole on sleeping ---

                     CHORUS.
                                 Hewn apart!
    Ai Ai!

                      MEDEA.
               I said not thus!

                    ALCESTIS.
                            I am so wild,
    Bewildered with these tears.

                     ACASTUS.
                                 Enough of this!
    It is the malice of that sorceress
    Disguised - she well knows how.  {118A}

                     CHORUS.
                               Thus, thus it is!
    We know the witch's cunning.

                      JASON.
                               dogs and fools!
    For this ye die.

                      MEDEA.
                       Nobility and love
    Urge my own sanction to support the wife!

                      JASON.
    I bade me queen prepare this spell.  Disputes
    Your arrogance my kingship?

                     ACASTUS.
                                  Ay, indeed!
    Now justice turns against thee, fickle jade
    As fortune.  Mine is a boy's arm, but I
    Advance against thee an impervious blade,
    And give thee in thy throat and teeth the lie!

                      JASON.
    Boy's bluster!

                      MEDEA.
                     Justice will be satisfied.
    It will be best to flee!

                      JASON.
                          But what is this?
    A sword?  I scorn a sword.  I scorn a boy.
    Let none suppose me fearful!

                      MEDEA.
                               give not back!

                      MEDEA.
    I will be finer far to go away
    As those disdaining aught but their own love.

                      MEDEA.
    Ay! let us leave these folk's ingratitude,
    My husband! in thy love alone I rest.
    This splendour and this toil alike resume
    Our life from the long honeymoon of love
    We wish at heart.  {118B}

                      JASON.
                   To Corinth!

                      MEDEA.
                                Creon bears
    The name of favourable to suppliants.

                     ACASTUS.
    How virtue tames these tameless ones!  To-day
    I am indeed a man.

                      MEDEA.
                        Thou brainless boy!
    Thus, thus, and thus I smite thee on the cheek --
    Thus, thus I spit upon thy face.  Out, dog!

                  SEMICHORUS I.
    His patience shows as something marvellous.

                  SEMICHORUS. 2.
    Virtue takes insult from the fortuneless.

                      MEDEA.
    The curse of Ares dog you into Hades!
    I have my reasons ["doubtfully"], ay, my reasons plain!
    Going, not forced.

                     CHORUS.
                         Yet going -- that is good!

                      JASON.
    To Corinth!  Bride of my own heart, Medea,
    Well hast thou put thy power off for the time
    Preferring love to pomp, and peace to revel --

                      MEDEA.
    And the soft cushions of the moss-grown trees
    To royal pillows, and the moon's young light
    To gaudy lamps of antique workmanship --  {119A}

                      JASON.
    And music of the birds to harps of gold
    Struck by unwilling fingers for gold coin.

                      MEDEA.
    Come! lest the curse I call upon this house
    Eat us up also!  May the red plague rot
    Their bones!  I lift my voice and prophesy:
    The curse shall never leave this house of fear;
    But one by treachery shall slay another,
    And vengeance shall smite one, and one lay bare
    Her beasts in vain for love: until the house
    Perish in uttermost red ruin.

                     CHORUS.
                                 Bah!
    Speared wild-cats bravely spit!

                      JASON.
                              To Creon, come!

                      MEDEA.
              Black Ares hath chosen
                Me wisely, to send
              A doom deep-frozen
                From now to the end.
              Never the curse
                Shall pass from the house,
              But gather a worse
                Hate for a spouse.
              The lovers are better
                Escaped from my toils
              Than these in the fetter
                Of the golden spoils.

              Yet still lies a doom
                For the royal lovers.
              Time bears in her womb
                That darkness covers
              A terror, and waits
              The hour that is Fate's.

      The work is done.  Let miracle inspire
      Iolchian voices to the holy hymn,
      Praise to black Ares, echo of this doom.  {119B}

                     CHORUS.
      So fearful is the wrath divine,
        That once aroused it shall not sleep,
      Though prostrate slaves before the shrine
        Pray, praise, do sacrifice, and weep.
      Ten generations following past
      Shall not exhaust the curse at last.

      From father unto son it flees,
        An awful heritage of woe.
      Wives feel its cancerous prodigies
        Invade their wombs; the children know
      The inexpiable word, exhaust
      Not by a tenfold holocauset.

      Thus let  mankind abase in fear
        Their hearts, nor sacrilege profane
      The awful slumber of the seer,
        The dread adytum of the fane;
      Nor gain the mockery of a fleece,
      Loosing reality of peace.  {120A}

      Hail to wild Ares!  Men, rejoice
        That He can thus avenge his shrine!
      One solemn cadence of that voice
        Peal through the ages, shake the spine
      Of very Time, and plunge success
      False-winged into sure-foot distress!

      Hail to black Ares!  Warrior, hail!
        Thou glory of the shining sword!
      What proven armour may avail
        Against the vengeance of the Lord?
      Athena's favour must withdraw
      Before the justice of thy law!

      Hail to the Lord of glittering spears,
        The monarch of the mighty name,
      The Master of ten thousand Fears
        Whose sword is as a scarlet flame!
      Hail to black Ares!  Wild and pale
      The echo answers me: All Hail!

             EXPLICIT ACTUS QUINTUS.

                    PARIS, "December" 9, 1902.


                     RONDEL.

    BY palm and pagoda enchaunted o'er-shadowed, I lie in the light
      Of stars that are bright beyond suns that all poets have vaunted
    In the deep-breathing amorous bosom of forests of amazon might
      By palm and pagoda enchaunted.

    By spells that are murmured and rays of my soul strongly flung, never
        daunted;
      By gesture of tracery traced with a wand dappled white;
    I summon the spirits of earth from the gloom they for ages have haunted.

    O woman of deep-red skin!  Carved hair like the teak!  O delight
      Of my soul in the hollows of earth -- how my spirit hath taunted --
    Away! I am here, I am laid to the breast of the earth in the dusk of the
        night,
      By palm and pagoda enchaunted.  {121A}


                      AHAB.

                     PART I.

    THE polished silver flings me back
      Dominant brows and eyes of bronze,
    A curling beard of vigorous black,
      And dusky red of desert suns
    Burnt in my cheeks.  Who saith me Nay?
    Who reigns in Israel to-day?

    Samaria in well-ordered ranks
      Of houses stands in honoured peace:
    Sweet nourishment from Kenah's banks
      Flows, and the corn and vine increase.
    In two pitched fields the Syrian hordes
    Fled broken from our stallion swords.

    Ay me!  But that was Life!  I see
      Now, from that hill, the ordered plain;
    The serried ranks like foam flung free,
      Long billows, flashing on the main.
    Past the eye's grip their legions roll --
    Anguish of death upon my soul!

    For, sheltered by the quiet hill,
      Like two small flocks of kids that wait,
    Going to water, ere the chill
      Flow from the East's forsaken gate,
    Lie my weak spears: O trembling tide
    Of fear false-faced and shifty-eyed!

    God! how we smote them in the morn!
      Their ravening tides rolled back anon,
    As if the cedared crest uptorn
      Roared from uprooted Lebanon
    Down to the sea, its billows hurled
    Back, past the pillars of the world!  {121B}

    Ah, that was life!  I feel my sword
      Live, bite, and shudder in my hand,
    Smite, drink, the spirit of its lord
      Exulting through the infinite brand!
    My chariot dyed with Syrian blood!
    My footmen wading through the flood!

    Ay! that was life!  Before the night
      Dipped its cool wings, their hosts were stricken
    Like night itself before the light.
      An hundred thousand corpses sicken
    The air of heaven.  Yet some by speed
    Escape our vengeance -- ours, indeed!

    Fate, the red hound, to Aphek followed.
      Some seven and twenty thousand died
    When the great wall uprising hollowed
      Its terror, crashed upon its side,
    And whelmed them in the ruin.  Strife,
    Strength, courage, victory -- that is Life!

    Then -- by my father's beard!  What seer
      Promised me victory?  What sage
    Now in my triumph hour severe
      Spits out red oracles of rage?
    Jehovah's.  The fanatic churl
    Stands -- see his thin lips writhe and curl!

    "Because thou has loosed the kingly man,
      To uttermost destruction's dread
    In my almighty power and plan
      Appointed, I will have thy head
    For his, thy life for his make mine,
    And for his folk thou hast spared, slay thine."

    But surely I was just and wise!
      Mercy is God's own attribute!
    Mercy to noble enemies
      Marks man from baser mould of brute,
    To fight their swordsmen -- who would shirk?
    To slay a captive -- coward's work!

    "I have loved mercy," that He said;
      Nor bade me slay the Syrian Chief.
    Yet my head answers for his head;
      My people take his people's grief.
    Sin, troth, to spare one harmless breath,
    Sith all my innocents earn death!  {122A}

    By timely mercy peace becomes,
      And kindly love, and intercourse
    Of goodly merchandise, that sums
      Contention in united force.
    "Praise who, relenting, shweth pity;
    Not him who captureth a city!"

    A wild strong life I've made of mine.
      Not till my one good deed is done --
    Ay! for that very deed divine --
      Comes the fierce mouth of malison.
    So grows my doubt again, so swell
    My ancient fears for Israel.

    I hurled Jehovah's altars down;
      I slew and I pursued his priests;
    I took a wife from Zidon Town;
      I gave his temple to the beasts;
    I set up gods and graven shapes
    Of calves an crocodiles and apes.

    Myself to sorceries I betook;
      All sins that are did I contrive,
    Sealed in the Thora's dreadful book --
      I live, and like my life, and thrive!
    Doth God not see!  His ear is dull?
    Or His speech strangled, His force null?

    Nay, verily!  These petty sins
      His mercy and long-suffering pardon.
    What final crime of horror wins
      At last His gracious heart to harden?
    What one last infamy shall wake
    His anger, for His great Name's sake?

    Is there on sin so horrible
      That no forgiveness can obtain,
    That flings apart the bars of hell,
      For which repentance shall be vain?
    Ay! but there is!  One act of ruth
    Done in my rash unthinking youth!

    Who wonders if I hold the scale
      Poised in my deep deliberate mind,
    Between the weight of Zidon's Baal
      And Judah's God -- each in his kind
    A god of power -- each in his fashion
    The hideous foeman of compassion?  {122B}

    The blood alike of man and beast
      The worship of each God demands.
    All priests are greedy -- gold and feast
      Pour from the poor folk to their hands.
    The doubtful power from heaven to strike
    The levin bolt they claim alike.

    I take no heed of trickery played
      By cunning mad Elijah's skill,
    When the great test of strength was made
      On Carmel's melancholy hill,
    And on the altar-stone the liar
    Cried "Water," and poured forth Greek fire!

    Then while the fools peer heavenward,
      Even as he prays, to see the skies
    Vomit the flash, his furtive sword
      Fast to the flinty altar flies.
    Whoof! the wild blaze assures the clods
    Jehovah is the God of gods!

    Nor do I set peculiar store
      By tricks twin-born to this they show
    When, with well-simulated lore
      Of learning, Baal's great hierarchs go
    Into the gold god's graven shell
    And moan the ambiguous oracle.

    In my own inmost heart I feel,
      Deep as a pearl in seas of Ind,
    A vision, keen as tempered steel,
      Lofty and holy as the wind,
    And brighter than the living sun:
    If these be gods, then there is none!

    Baal and Jehovah, Ashtoreth
      And Chemosh and these Elohim,
    Life's pandars in the brothel, Death!
      Cloudy imaginings, a dream
    Built up of fear and words and woe.
    All, all my soul must overthrow.

    For these are devils, nothing doubt!
      Yet nought should trouble me: I see
    My folk secure from foes without,
      Worship in peace and amity
    Baal and Jehovah, sects appeased
    By peace assured and wealth increased.  {123A}

    Yet am I troubled.  Doubt exists
      And absolute proof recoils before me.
    Truth veils herself in awful mists,
      And darkness wakens, rolling o'er me
    When I approach the dreadful shrine,
    In my own soul, of the divine.

    And what cries laughing Jezebel?
      Golden and fragrant as the morn,
    Painted like flames adorning Hell,
      Passions and mysteries outworn,
    Ever enchanting, ever wise,
    And terror in her wondrous eyes!

    Her fascination steals my strength,
      Her luxury lures me as she comes;
    Reaches her length against my length,
      And breaks my spirit; life succumbs --
    A nameless avatar of death
    Incarnate in her burning breath.

    I know her gorgeous raiment folded
      In snaky subtle draperies,
    All stalwart captains mighty-moulded
      To lure within her sorceries,
    Within her bed -- and I, who love,
    See, and am silent, and approve!

    Strange!  Who shall call the potter knave
      Who moulds a vessel to his will?
    One, if he choose, a black-browed slave;
      One, if he choose, a thing of ill,
    Writhing, misshapen, footless, cruel:
    One, like a carved Assyrian jewel?

    Shame on the potter heavy sit,
      If he revenge his own poor skill
    That marred a work by lack of wit,
      By heaping infamy and ill
    On the already ruined clay.
    Shame on the potter, then, I say!

    But what cries laughing Jezebel?
      Scornful of me as all her lovers,
    More scornful as we love her well!
      "Good king, this rage of doubt discovers
    The long-hid secret!  All thy mind
    A little shadow lurks behind."  {123B}

    Hers are the delicate sorceries
      In black groves: hers the obscure, obscene
    Rites in dim moonlight courts; the wise
      Dreadful occasions when the queen
    Like to a bat, flits, flits, to gloat
    Blood-drunk upon a baby's throat!

    Therefore: all doubt, this fierce unrest
      Between the knowledge self bestows
    And leaves of palm, and palimpsest,
      Scrawled sacred scrolls, whose legend goes
    Beyond recorded time, and founds
    Its age beyond all history's bounds;

    Therefore: all search for truth beyond
      The doubtful cannon of the law,
    The bitter letter of the bond
      Given when Sinai shook with awe,
    They swear; all wit that looks aslant
    Shamed at the shameful covenant;<<1>>

<<1.Circumcision, medically commendable, is both ridiculous and obscene if considered as a religious rite.  Gen. xviii. 9-14.>>

    Therefore: this brooding over truth
      She much avers cuts short my day,
    Steals love and laughter from my youth,
      Will dye my beard in early grey.
    "Go forth to war!  Shall Judah still
    Set mockery to thy kingly will?"

    May be.  I often feel a ghost
      Creeping like darkness through my brain;
    Sensed like uncertainty at most,
      Nowise akin to fear or pain.
    Yet it is there.  To yield to such
    And brood, will not avail me much.

    Ho! harness me my chariot straight,
      My white-nmaned horses fleet and strong!
    Call forth the trumpeters of state!
      Proclaim to all Samaria's throng:
    The King rides forth!  Hence, slaves!  Away!
    Haste ye!  The King rides forth today.  {124A}


                     PART II.

    WOULD God that I were dead!  Like Cain,
      My punishment I cannot bear.
    There is a deep corrosive pain
      Invades my being everywhere.
    Spring from a seed too small to see,
    A monster spawns and strangles me.

    'Tis scarce a week!  In power and pride
      I rode in state about the city;
    Took pleasure in the eager ride,
      Saw grief, took pleasure in my pity;
    Say joy, took pleasure in the seeing,
    And the full rapture of well-being.

    Would God that I had stayed, and smote
      My favourite captain through the heart,
    Caught my young daughter by the throat,
      And torn her life and limbs apart,
    Stabbed my queen dead; remorse for these
    Might ape, not match, these miseries.

    For, hard behind the palace gate,
      I spied a vineyard fair and fine,
    Hanging with purple joy, and weight
      Of golden rapture of the vine:
    And there I bade my charioteer
    Stay, and bid Naboth to appear.

    The beast!  A gray, deceitful man,
      With twisted mouth the beard would hide,
    Evil yet strong: the scurril clan
      Exaggerate for its greed and pride,
    The scum of Israel!  At one look
    I read my foe as in a book.

    The beast!  He grovelled in the dust.
      I heard the teeth gride as he bowed
    His forehead to the earth.  Still just,
      Still patient, passionless, and proud,
    I ruled my heavy wrath.  I passed
    That hidden insult: spake at last.

    I spake him fair.  My memory held
      Him still a member of my folk;
    A warrior might be bold of eld,
      My hardy spearman when we broke
    The flashing lines of Syrians.  Yea!
    I spake him fair.  Alas the day!  {124B}

    "Friend, by my palace lies thy field
      Fruitful and pleasant to the sight.
    Therefore I pray thee that thou yield
      Thy heritage for my delight.
    Wilt thou its better?  Or its fee
    In gold, as seemeth good to thee?

    "Content thyself!"  As by a spell
      He rears his bulk in surly rage.
    "The Lord forbid that I should sell
      To thee my father's heritage!"
    No other word.  Dismissal craves?<<1>>
    Nay, scowls and slinks among his slaves.

<<1. In the East the inferior dare not leave the presence of his superior without permission.>>

    Hath ever a slave in story dared
      Thus to beard openly his lord?
    My chariot men leapt forth and flared
      Against him with indignant sword.
    Why wait for king's word to expunge
    Live so detested with one lunge?

    "Cease!"  My strong word flamed out.  The men
      Shook with dead fear.  They jumped and caught
    With savage instinct, brutal ken,
      At what should be my crueller thought:
    Torture!  And trembled lest their haste
    Had let a dear life run to waste.

    They argued after their brute kind.
      I have two prides; in justice, one:
    In mercy, one: "No ill I find
      In this just man," I cried; "the sun
    Is not defiled, and takes no hurt
    When the worm builds his house of dirt.

    "Curse ye Jehovah!  He abides,
      Hears not, nor smites; the curse is pent
    Close with the speaker; ill betides
      When on himself the curve is bent,
    And like the wild man's ill-aimed blow,<<1>>
    Hits nought, swerves, swoops, and strikes him low.  {125A}

<<1. Another reference to the boomerang.>>

    "Let the man go!"  The short surprise
      Sinks in long wonder: angrily
    Yet awed they spurn him forth.  "Arise!
      O swine, and wallow in thy sty!
    The King hath said it."  Thus the men
    Turned the beast free -- to goad again.

    For not the little shadow shapes
      An image ever in my brain;
    Across my field of sight there gapes
      Ever a gulf, and draws the pain
    Of the whole knowledge of the man
    Into its vague and shifting span.

    Moreover, in that gulf I see
      Now the bright vineyard sweet and clean,
    Now the dog Naboth mocking me
      With rude curt word and mouth obscene
    Wried in derision -- well relied
    Dog's insolence on monarch's price.

    Ah, friend!  Some winds may shake a city!
      Some dogs may creep too near a feast!
    Thou, reckoning on my scorn, my pity,
      Thine own uncleanness as a beast:
    Wilt thou not take thy count again?
    Seest thou the shadow on my brain?

    It grows, it grows.  Seven days slide past:
      I groan upon an empty bed:
    I turn my face away: I fast:
      There cometh in my mouth no bread.
    No mad dare venture near to say:
    "Why turns the King his face away?"

    It grows.  Ah me! the long days slide;
      I brood; due justice to the man
    Dogging desire.  A monarch's pride
      Outweighs his will: yet slowlier ran
    To-day the thought: "I will no wrong:"
    "The vines are cool," more sweet and strong

    There is no sleep.  All natural laws
      Suspend their function: strange effects
    And mighty for so slight a cause!
      What whim of weakling strength protects
    This dog of Satan at my gate
    From the full whirlwind of my hate?  {125B}

    What mighty weakness stays the king
      If he arise, and cast desire
    Far from its seat and seed and spring
      To Hinnom the detested fire?
    Ay! both were wise.  Madness alone
    Sits throned on the king's vacant throne.

    Dogs!  Who dares break on me?  "Dread lord!
      Mightiest of monarchs!" -- "Cease, thou crow!
    Thine errand! ere the eunuch's sword
      Snatch thy bald head off at a blow."
    "Mercy, World's Light!"  Swings clear and clean
    The call "Room for the Queen!  The Queen!"

    Strong as a man, the Queen strides in.
      Even she shrank frighted! -- my aspect
    More dreadful than all shapes of sin
      Her dreams might shape or recollect,
    Hideous with fasting, madness, grief,
    Beyond all speaking or belief.

    But the first glance at those bold eyes!
      Ah! let me fling me at her feet!
    Take me, O love!  Thy terror flies.
      Kiss me again, again, O sweet!
    O honeyed queen, old paramour,
    So keen our joy be and so sure!

    "The king would be alone!"  Fast fly
      The trembling lackeys at her voice.
    Lapped in her billowy breasts I lie,
      And love, and languish, and rejoice,
    And -- ah -- forget!  The ecstatic hour
    Bursts like a poppy into flower.

    Back! thou black spectre!  In her arms
      Devouring and devoured of love,
    Feeding my face in myriad charms,
      As on a mountain feeds a dove,
    Starred with fresh flowers, dew-bright, and pearled
    With all the light of all the world: {126A}

    Back!  With the kisses ravening fast
      Upon my panting mouth, the eyes
    Darting hot showers of light, the vast
      And vicious writings, the caught sighs
    Drunk with delight, on love's own throne,
    The moment where all time lies prone:

    Back!  At the very central shrine,
      Pinnacled moment of excess
    Of immolation's blood divine:
      Back! from the fleshy loveliness:
    Back! loved and loathed!  O face concealed!
    Back!  One hath whispered "Naboth's field."

    I am slain.  Her body passion-pearled
      Dreams her luxurious lips have drawn
    My spirit, as the dust wind-whirled
      Sucks up the radiance of the dawn
    In rainbow beauty<<1>> -- yet remains
    Mere dust upon the barren plains.

<<1. "Dust-devils" show opalescence in certain aspects of light.>>

    Reluctance to reveal my grief
      Is of my sickness a strange feature.
    Yea, verily! beyond belief
      Is the machinery of man's nature!
    If thus spake Solomon in kind
    Of body, I of soul and mind!

    The lazy accents stir at last
      The scented air: "Oh, wherefore, lord,
    Is thy soul sad?  This weary fast
      Strikes to my heart a lonely sword!"
    In brief words stammered forth I spoke
    My secret; and the long spell broke.

    And now the gilded sin of her
      Leapt and was lambent in a smile:
    "Give me but leave to minister
      This kingdom for a little while!
    The vineyard shall be thine.  O king,
    This trouble is a little thing!"  {126B}

    I gave to her the signet's gold
      Carved in the secret charactery,
    Whose flowers of writing bend and fold
      The star of Solomon, the eye
    Whence four rays run -- the Name! the seal
    Written within the burning wheel.

    And now I lean with fevered will
      Across the carven screen of palm.
    All nature holds its function still;
      The sun is mild; the wind is calm;
    But on my ear the voices fall
    Distant, and irk me, and appal.

    Two men have sworn the solemn oath:
      "God and the king this dog blasphemed,"
    Two judges, just, though little loth,
      Weigh, answer.  As on one who dreamed
    Comes waking -- in my soul there groaned:
    "Carry forth Naboth to be stoned!"

    Nine days!  And still the king is sad,
      And hides his face, and is not seen.
    The tenth! the king is gaily clad;
      The king will banquet with the queen;
    And, ere the west be waste of sun,
    Enjoy the vinyard he hath won.

    All this I hear as one entranced.
      The king and I are friend and friend,
    As if a cloud of maidens danced
      Between my vision and the end.
    I see the king as one afeared,
    Hiding his anguish in his beard.

    I laugh in secret, knowing well
      What waits him in the field of blood;
    What message hath the seer to tell;
      What bitter Jordan holds its flood
    Only for Ahab, sore afraid
    What lurks behind the vine's cool shade.

    Yet -- well I see -- the fates are sure,
      And Ahab will descend, possess
    The enchanting green, the purple lure,
      The globes of nectared loveliness,
    And, as he turns! who wonders now
    The grim laugh wrinkles on my brow?  {127A}

    I see him, a fantastic ghost,
      The vineyard smiling white and plain,
    And hiding ever innermost
      The little shadow on his brain;
    I laugh again with mirthless glee,
    As knowing also I am he.

    A fool in gorgeous attire!
      An ox decked bravely for his doom!
    So step I to the great desire.
      Sweet winds upon the gathering gloom
    Bend like a mother, as I go,
    Foreknowing, to my overthrow.


                 NEW YEAR, 1903.

    O FRIENDS and brothers!  Hath the year deceased,
    And ye await the bidding to fare well?
    How shall ye fare, thus bound of fate in hell?
    How, whom no light hath smitten, and released?
    Yet trust perchance in God, or man, or priest?
    Ay!  Let them serve you, let them save you!  Spell
    The name that guards the human citadel,
    And answer if your course hath checked or ceased.

    Path of the eightfold star!  Be thou revealed!
    Isle of Nirvana, be the currents curled
    About thee, that the swimmer touch thy shore!
    Thought be your sword, and virtue be your shield!
    Press on!  Who conquers shall for evermore
    Pass from the fatal mischief of the world.


                    MELUSINE.
                   TO M. M. M.

    HANGS over me the fine false gold
      Above the bosom epicene
        That hides my head that hungereth.
    The steady eyes of steel behold,
      When on a sudden the fierce and thin
        Curled subtle mouth swoops on my breath, {127B}
    And like a serpent's mouth is cold,
      And like a serpent's mouth is keen,
        And like a serpent's mouth is death.

    Lithe arms, wan with love's mysteries,
      Creep round and close me in, as Thule
        Wraps Arctic oceans ultimate;
    Some deathly swoon or sacrifice,
      This love -- a red hypnotic jewel
        Worn in the forehead of a Fate!
    And like a devil-fish is ice,
      And like a devil-fish is cruel,
        And like a devil-fish is hate.

    Beneath those kisses songs of sadness
      Sob, in the pulses of desire,
        Seeking some secret in the deep;
    Low melodies of stolen gladness,
      The bitterness of death; the lyre
        Broken to bid the viol weep:
    And like a Maenad's chants are madness,
      And like a Maenad's chants are fire,
        And like a Maenad's chants are sleep.

    A house of pain is her bedchamber.
      Her skin electric clings to mine,
        Shakes for pure passion, moves and hisses;
    Whose subtle perfumes half remember
      Old loves, and desolate divine
        Wailings among the wildernesses;
    And like a Hathor's skin is amber,
      And like a Hathor's skin is wine,
        And like a Hathor's skin is kisses.

    Gray steel self-kindled shine her eyes.
      They rede strange runes of time defiled,
        And ruined souls, and Satan's kin.
    I see their veiled impurities,
      An harlot hidden in a child,
        Through all their love and laughter lean;
    And like a witch's eyes are wise,
      And like a witch's eyes are wild,
        And like a witch's eyes are Sin.

    She moves her breasts in Bacchanal
      Rhymes to that music manifold
        That pulses in the golden head,  {128A}
    Seductive phrase perpetual,
      Terrible both to change or hold;
        They move, but all their light is fled;
    And like a dead girl's breasts are small,
      And like a dead girl's breasts are cold,
        And like a dead girl's breasts are dead.

    Forests and ancient haunts of sleep
      See dawn's intolerable spark
        While yet fierce darkness lingereth.
    So I, their traveller, sunward creep,
      Hail Ra uprising in his bark,
        And feel the dawn-wind's sombre breath.
    Strange loves rise up, and turn, and weep!
      Our warm wet bodies may not mark
        How these spell Satan's shibboleth
    And like a devil's loves are deep,
      And like a devil's loves are dark,
        And like a devil's loves are death.


                    THE DREAM.

    BEND down in dream the shadow-shape
      Of tender breasts and bare!
    Let the long locks of gold escape
    And cover me and fall and drape
      A pall of whispering hair!
    And let the starry eyes look through
      That mist of silken light,
    And lips drop forth their honey-dew
    And gentle sighs of sleep renew
      The scented winds of night!
    As purple clusters of pure grapes
      Distil their dreamy wine
    Whose fragrance from warm fields escapes
    On shadowy hills and sunny capes
      In lands of jassamine!
    So let thy figure faintly lined
      In pallid flame of sleep
    With love inspire the dreamer's mind,
    Young love most delicate and kind,
      With love -- how calm and deep!
    Let hardly half a smile revive
      The thoughts of waking hours.
    How sad it is to be alive!
    How well the happy dead must thrive
      In green Elysian bowers!  {128B}
    A sleep as deep as their bestow,
      Dear angel of my dreams!
    Bid time now cease its to-and-fro
    That I may dwell with thee, and know
      The soul from that which seems!
    The long hair sobs in closer fold
      And deeper curves of dawn;
    The arms bend closer, and the gold
    Burns brighter, and the eyes are cold
      With life at last withdrawn.
    And all the spirit passing down
      Involves my heart with gray:
    So the pale stars of even crown
    The glow of twilight; dip and drown
      The last despairs of day.
    Oh! closer yet and closer yet
      The pearl of faces grows.
    The hair is woven like a net
    Of moonlight round me: sweet is set
      The mouth's unbudded rose.
    Oh never! did our lips once meet
      The dream were done for ever,
    And death should dawn, supremely sweet,
    One flash of knowledge subtle and fleet
      Borne on the waveless river.  {129A}
    And therefore in the quiet hour
      I rose from lily pillows
    And swiftly sought the jasmine bower
    Still sleeping, moonlight for a dower,
      And bridal wreaths of willows.
    And there I laid me down again:
      The stream flowed softly by:
    And thought the last time upon pain,
    Earth's joy -- the sad permuted strain
      Of tears and ecstasy.
    And there the dream came floating past
      Borne in an ivory boat,
    And all the world sighed low "At last."
    The shallop waited while I cast
      My languid limbs afloat
    To drift with eyelids skyward turned
      Up to the shadowy dream
    Shaped like a lover's face, that burned;
    To drift toward the soul that yearned
      For this -- the hour supreme!
    So drifting I resigned the sleep
      For death's diviner bliss;
    As mists in rain of springtide weep,
    Life melted in the dewfall deep
      Of death's kiss in a kiss.  {129

[The idea of this obscure and fantastic play is as follows: --
  By a glorious act human misery is secured (History of Christianity).
  Hence, appreciation of the personality of Jesus is no excuse for being a Christian.
  Inversely, by a vile and irrational series of acts human happiness is secured (Story of the play).
  Hence, attacks on the Mystics of History need not cause us to condemn Mysticism.
  Also, the Knowledge of Good and Evil is a Tree whose fruit Man has not yet tasted: so that the Devil cheated Eve indeed; or (more probably) Eve cheated Adam.  Unless (most probable of all) God cheated the Devil, and the fruit was a common apple after all.  Cf. H. Maudsley, "Life in Mind and Conduct."]

   ["The Scene is an old Baronial Hall, elaborately, yet somewhat grotesquely
       (from the incongruity), fitted up as an antique Egyptian temple.
       Centre: an altar between two obelisks; on it a censer vomits smoke in
       great volumes.  Above at back of stage is a stately throne, square and
       simple, on steps.  In it sits" MAURYA, "quiet and silent.  She is
       dressed in sombre green robes, lightened with old rose facings.  She
       is heavily braceleted and ankleted with gold, and her crown is a gold
       disc, supported in silver horns, rising" {130A} "from her forehead.
       Above her is a rude painted board, representing the Winged Globe in
       many colours.  Before the altar" CRIOSDA "is kneeling; he is dressed in
       a white robe fastened by a blue sash.  A leopard's skin is over his
       shoulders, clasped with a golden clasp about his neck.  He bears an
       "ankh" in his left hand, in his right a caduceus<<1>> wand.  On his
       head is the winged helmet of Mercury, and his sandals are winged also.
       He is muttering low some fervent prayer, and anon casts incense upon
       the censer.  The low muttering continues for a considerable time,"
       MAURYA "remaining quite still, as one rapt in her own thoughts.
       Suddenly, with startling vehemence, the song breaks out."

    The world is borne upon thy breast
      Even as the rose.  {130B}
    Wilt thou not lull it into rest,
      Some strong repose
    More satisfying than pale sleep;
    Than death more long, more deep?

    Hail! at the twilight as at dawn!
      The sunset close
    Even on the lake as on the lawn!
      The red ray glows
    Across the woven stardrift's ways
    In mystery of Maurya's praise.

      These subtler throes
    Than love's or life's, invade, divide
      The world of woes.

            expecting a grace."
          [MAURYA, "like one in trance, rises slowly, gathers her robes about
            her, and descends to the altar.  Reaching over it, she bends and
            lifts him by his outstretched arms.  She puts her lips to his
            forehead, and he, with a deep gasp, as of one in ecstasy not to be
            borne, drops back, breathing deeply.  She lifts her hands, and
            brings them slowly, very forcibly, forward, and says solemnly:"

            with ermine.  Her bronze-gold hair is coiled wonderfully about her
            head." {131A} "She comes down stage to" CRIOSDA, "who rises on one
            knee and takes her thereon.  She removes his helmet and strokes
            gently his hair."

      CRIOSDA.  Maurya, little sister!
          ["He smiles with deep tenderness; suddenly a pang catches him; he
            strikes at his throat, and cries sharply:"
    Ah!            ["Shivers with terrible emotion."
      MAURYA.  Criosda, ever the same!  The old world runs
    On Wheels of laughter for us little ones;
    To you, whose shoulders strain, the chariot seems
    A poised fiend flogging you to hell.
      CRIOSDA.                  These thoughts,
    Maurya, -- Maurya! they become you not.
    Child, to see sorrow is to taste it.
      MAURYA.                             No;
    For such a sorrow is its own calm joy.
    But -- share me now your pain.
      CRIOSDA.  ["In agony."]  No! no! not that!

      MAURYA.  I am heavy?
      CRIOSDA.  Heavy as my own heart's fear.
      MAURYA.  You fear?  Am I in fault?  Is Maurya maid
    The foe to Maurya goddess?
      CRIOSDA.                 Ah, indeed!
      MAURYA.  Is not the work nigh ready?
          [CRIOSDA "grips his caduceus, which he has dropped, and presses it
            savagely to his breast.  Then, with a mingled burst of ferocity
            and joy, dashes" MAURYA "aside to the ground, reaches his hand
            towards the empty throne, apostrophising it, and cries with a
            strident laugh;" {131B}

    Andrew found the passage! and the next day he was dead -- murdered,
    murdered!  Oh, how horrible! -- what a horrible place this is with all its
    beauty and love! and my worship -- oh, how strange it all is.  Criosda!
    come!

      CRIOSDA.  ["Recovering."]  Who is at the door?  Back, back.  It is ill
    luck, ill luck, I say.  Where is old Andrew?  The faithful fool -- Oh, the
    last dreadful look of his glazed eyes!  What am I saying?  Maurya, girl,
    go!  I must tend the temple.  I must be alone.  It is not fitting --
      MAURYA.  You are ill; come and be tended yourself, first.
      CRIOSDA.  No! I am well.  You are a girl, not a God.

      CRIOSDA.  Stop, don't!
    ["Aside."]  I must be man -- tut! tut!

    Those whom we worship as our gods are gods.
    The power is mine: that art no skill resists.
    No God dethrones himself; none can.
    Will he, nill he, God must be God: it is a luckless fate for a girl's
        dower, a thankless way for a maiden's feet.
      MAURYA.  Why, then, am I not the Goddess Maurya?
      CRIOSDA.  Yes! yes! of course, but only by my making.
      MAURYA.  Was not my birth miraculous? and strange
    The death of the old people of this house
    That left you guardian?
      CRIOSDA.      Yes, girl, that was strange.  {132B}
      MAURYA.  Then, is the power that makes me in the end
    True Goddess Maurya, yours, yours only?
      CRIOSDA.  ["Solemnly."]  No!
    Stop! ask no more!  There lies the awful crux.
    Blind are fate's eyes, and pinioned are will's wings.
    In you the whole chance lies.

      CRIOSDA.                   In you.

      CRIOSDA.  Ah then!  No, no, it is not yet enough.
    Not definite yet.  Stop! fool, shall I hint and ruin all with a word?
        Backwards or forwards, the blow goes home either way.  ["Looks at her
        with keen fierce eyes."]  Ah!
      MAURYA.  ["A little frightened."]  Come, O my brother!
    It is time to go.
      CRIOSDA.  No! leave me.  It is but an hour.
          [MAURYA "smiles; leaves her hand a little in his, and so passes out
            slowly through the open door with her eyes fixed in love and trust
            on him."  CRIOSDA "starts up and pulls fiercely at a second lever,
            and the door clangs to with the same nerve shattering shock."
            CRIOSDA "staggers to altar; and, with his hand on it, turns
            towards door."
      Mouths of God's mercy!  I would her eyes were bleeding wounds in my
    heart!  Ah though!  If she were a dog I could not do it.  She is my sister

    It is a year to-night.  I arrayed her first
    In yon gold ornaments -- My brain is sick!
    I want coffee -- or hashish -- No!  That is for her!

           electricity, the globes being the eyes of strange sculptured stone
           beasts on the walls."

    fault! -- Ay! and a crime, a crime at which the stars shake in the heaven,
    men might think.  Yet the stars, I will wager, are indifferent.  True, the
    news has not reached them: true, that star I see is not a star; it was so

    So for long years I have dared.  First the twin death
    Of the dotards, slow constraint of Maurya's mind

    Whose sweet reversion hangs above me now:
    To order luck!
      CRIOSDA.  Skill orders luck!

              No!  No!
              Ho!  Ho! {137A}
      CRIOSDA.  Thou sinister one!  Thy rite I duly did;
    That drugged (and dancing with delight thereof
    The maiden's mind) the maiden's body prone
    Lay on her altar.  Then she gave consent,
    And I smote once.
      RUPHA.  Ha!  Ha!
              What came them?
      CRIOSDA.  I tore out her heart,
    And held its flame aloft.  The blackening blood
    Gushed on my arms -- and then --
      RUPHA.  Ho!  HO!
      CRIOSDA.  With red lips reeking from the sweet foul feast,
    I sang in tuneless agony the spell;
    Rolled athwart space the black words: then some force
    Tore me: I heard the tears drop in my heart.
    I heard the laughter of some utmost God
    Hid in the middle of matter.  That was I,
    The hideous laugher of the maniac laugh
    When loathing makes the bed to lust, and twine
    The limbs of agony about the trunk
    Of torture -- rapture stabbing through -- Maurya!
    Ay, that was I; ,and I the weeping wolf
    That howls about this hell that is my heart;
    And I the icy and intangible
    That beholds all, and is not.

              One in three!

              Glory to thee!

              Enough!
              It will grow.
              Ho!  Ho!
      CRIOSDA.  In English, I was mad.  But no new portents
    Confound the course of the sun. I left my home
    To seek thee out.  When skill availed me not,
    I put to sea to try the Luck of Maurya. {137B}
      RUPHA.  Thou shouldst have tried that first of all.
      CRIOSDA.        Why then
    The Luck may avail if that wried tongue can speak
    Straight!  Hast thou aught to bid me do?
    To me naught matters more.  My life I cast
    On the one throw; and, having lost, I have lost.
    I am indifferent to my fate as the stars
    Are to my curses, were I fool enough
    To curse.
      RUPHA.  Destiny has strange ways.
      CRIOSDA.                   I care not.
      RUPHA.  How long hast thou left home?
      CRIOSDA.                    Seven years.
      RUPHA.                          Return!
      CRIOSDA.              How can I?
      RUPHA.  Stamp the boat beneath thy feet
    Down wallowing in the trough!
      CRIOSDA.                     It is done!
        ["The boat sinks from under" CRIOSDA.  "He would sink did he not grasp
          the staff extended to him."
      RUPHA.  Now, stand alone!
      CRIOSDA.                     I stand.
      RUPHA.               Then break, O vision
    Of sea; awake, O vision of the shrine!
      CRIOSDA.  All is illusion?
      RUPHA.              All.  Murder a mode
    And love a mode of the unknown that is,
    That nor thyself nor I can ever see.
    Yet, so far as may be, awake, O shrine!
          ["She strikes the sea with her staff; the storm rises; it grows

    Rings through eternity past the poles of space.

    Shall glitter in thine eyes: for the hour strikes.

    Two thousand years from now.

    Multitudes many-coloured, grave and tall,

    In infinite musical labyrinths about.

"YOU  are said!" the Knight said, in an anxious tone; "let me sing you a song to comfort you."<<This passage is a parody on one in "Alice through the Looking-Glass.">>
  "Is it very long" Alice asked.
  "It's long," said the Knight, "but it's 'very very' beautiful.  The name of the song is called 'The Book of the Beast.'"
  "Oh! how ugly!" cried Alice.
  "Never mind," said the mild creature.  "'Some' people call it 'Reason in Rhyme.'"
  "But which 'is' the name of the song?" Alice said, trying not to seem too interested.
  "Ah, you don't understand," the Knight said, looking a little vexed.  "That's what the name is 'called.'  The name really 'is' 'Ascension Day and Pentecost; with some Prose Essays and an Epilogue,' just as the title is 'The Sword of Song' you know, just in the same way, just in the same way, just in the same way . . ."
  Alice put her fingers in her ears and gave a little scream.  "Oh, dear me!  That's {140A} harder than ever!" she said to herself, and then, looking determinedly intelligent: "So 'that's' what the song is called.  I see.  But what 'is' the song?"
  "You must be a perfect fool," said the Knight, irritably.  "The song is called 'Shout Doubt; or the Agnostic's Anthology,' by the author of 'Gas Manipulation,' 'Solutions,' 'The Management of Retorts,' and other physical works of the first order -- but that's only what it's 'called,' you know."
  "Well, what 'is' the song then?" said Alice, who was by this time completely bewildered.
  "If I wished to be obscure, child," said the Knight, rather contemptuously, "I should tell you that the Name of the Title was 'What a man of 95 ought to know,' as endorsed by eminent divines, and that. . ."  Seeing that she only began to cry, he broke off and continued in a gentler tone: "it 'means,' my dear. . . "  He stopped short, for she was taking no notice; but as her figure was bent by sobs into something very like a note of interrogation: "You want to know that it 'is,' {140B} I suppose!" continued the knight, in a superior, but rather offended voice.
  "If you would, please, sir!"
  "Well, 'that,'" pronounced the knight, with the air of having thoroughly studied the question and reached a conclusion absolutely final and irreversible, "'that,' Goodness only knows.  But I will sing it to you."

                INTRODUCTION TO "ASCENSION DAY AND PENTECOST."

NOT a word to introduce my introduction!  Let me instantly launch the Boat of Discourse on the Sea of Religious Speculation, in danger of the Rocks of Authority and the Quicksands of Private Interpretation, Scylla and Charybdis.  Here is the strait; what God shall save us from shipwreck?  If we choose to understand the Christian (or any other) religion literally, we are at once overwhelmed by its inherent impossibility.  Our credulity is outraged, our  moral sense shocked, the holiest foundations of our inmost selves assailed by no ardent warrior in triple steel, but by a loathly and disgusting worm.  That this is so, the apologists for the religion in question, whichever it may be, sufficiently indicate (as a rule) by the very method of their apology.  The alternative is to take the religion symbolically, esoterically; but to move one step in this direction is to start on a journey whose end cannot be determined.  The religion, ceasing to be a tangible thing, an object uniform for all sane eyes, becomes rather that mist whereon the sun of the soul casts up, like Brocken spectre, certain vast and vague images of the beholder himself, with or without a glory encompassing them.  The function of the facts is then quite passive: it matters little or nothing whether the cloud be the red mist of Christianity, or the glimmering silver-white of Celtic Paganism; the hard grey dim-gilded of Buddhism, the fleecy opacity of Islam, or the mysterious medium of those ancient faiths which come up in as many colours as their investigator has moods.<<"In order to get over the ethical difficulties presented by the naive naturalism of many parts of those Scriptures, in the divine authority of which he firmly believed, Philo borrowed from the Stoics (who had been in like straits in respect of Greek mythology) that great Excalibur which they had forged with infinite pains and skill -- the method of allegorical interpretation.  This mighty 'two-handed engine at the door' of the theologian is warranted to make a speedy end of any and every moral or intellectual difficulty, by showing that, taken allegorically, or, as it is otherwise said, 'poetically' or 'in a spiritual sense,' the plainest words mean whatever a pious interpreter desires they should mean" (Huxley, "Evolution of Theology"). -- A. C.>> {141B}  If the student has advances spiritually so that he can internally, infallibly perceive what is Truth, he will find it equally well symbolised in most external faiths.
  It is curious that Browning never turns his wonderful faculty of analysis upon the fundamental problems of religion, as it were an axe laid to the root of the Tree of Life.  It seems quite clear that he knew what would result if he did so.  We cannot help fancying that he was unwilling to do this.  The proof of his knowledge I find in the following lines: --

    "I have read much, thought much, experienced much,
    Yet would die rather than avow my fear
    The Naples' liquefaction may be false . . .
    I hear you recommend, I might at least
    Eliminate, decrassify my faith
    Since I adopt it: keeping what I must
    And leaving what I can; such points as this . . .
    Still, when you bid me purify the same,
    To such a process I discern no end . . .
    First cut the liquefaction, what comes last
    But Fichte's clever cut at God himself? . . .
    I trust nor hand, nor eye, nor heart, nor brain
    To stop betimes: they all get drunk alike.
    The first step, I am master not to take."

  This is surely the apotheosis of wilful ignorance!  We may think, perhaps, that Browning is "hedging" when, in the last paragraph, he says: "For Blougram, he believed, say, half he spoke,"<<Probably a record for a bishop. -- A. C.>> and hints at some deeper ground.  It is useless to say, "This is Blougram and not Browning."  Browning could hardly have described the dilemma without seeing it.  What he really believes is, perhaps, a mystery.
  That Browning, however, believes in universal salvation, though he nowhere (so far as I know) gives his reasons, save as they are summarised in the last lines of the below-quoted stanza of "Apparent Failure," and from his final pronouncement of the Pope on Guido, represented in Browning's masterpiece as a Judas without the decency to hang himself.

    "So ("ie." by suddenness of fate) may the truth be flashed out by one
       blow,
    And Guido see one instant and be saved.
    Else I avert my face nor follow him
    Into that sad obscure sequestered state
    Where God unmakes but to remake the soul
    He else made first in vain: which must not be."  {142A}

  This may be purgatory, but is sounds not unlike reincarnation.
  It is at least a denial of the doctrine of eternal punishment.
  As for myself, I took the first step years ago, quite in ignorance of what the last would lead to.  God is indeed cut away -- a cancer from the breast of truth.
  Of those philosophers, who from unassailable premisses draw by righteous deduction a conclusion against God, and then for His sake overturn their whole structure by an act of will, like a child breaking an ingenious toy, I take Mansel as my type.<<As represented by his Encyclopaedia article; not in such works as "Limits of Religious Thought." -- A.C.>>
  Now, however, let us consider the esoteric idea-mongers of Christianity, Swedenborg, Anna Kingsford, Deussen and the like, of whom I have taken Caird as my example.  I wish to unmask these people: I perfectly agree with nearly everything they say, but their claim to be Christians is utterly confusing, and lends a lustre to Christianity which is quite foreign.  Deussen, for example, coolly discards nearly all the Old Testament, and, picking a few New Testament passages, often out of their context, claims his system as Christianity.  Luther discards James.  Kingsford calls Paul the Arch Heretic.  My friend the "Christian Clergyman" accepted Mark and Acts -- until pushed.  Yet Deussen is honest enough to admit that Vedanta teaching is identical, but clearer! and he quite clearly and sensibly defines Faith -- surely the most essential quality for the adherent to Christian dogma -- as "being convinced on insufficient evidence."  Similarly the dying-to-live idea of Hegel (and Schopenhauer) claimed by Caird as the central spirit of Christianity is far older, in the Osiris Myth of the Egyptians.  These ideas are all right, but they have no more to do with Christianity than the Metric System with the Great Pyramid.  But see Piazzi Smyth!<<An astronomer whose brain gave way.  He prophesied the end of the world in 1881, from measurements made in the Great Pyramid.>>  Henry Morley has even the audacity to claim Shelley -- Shelley! -- as a Christian "in spirit."
  Talking of Shelley: -- With regard to my open denial of the personal Christian God, may it not be laid to my charge that I have dared to voice in bald language what Shelley {142B} sang in words of surpassing beauty: for of course the thought in one or two passages of this poem is practically identical with that in certain parts of "Queen Mab" and "Prometheus Unbound."  But the very beauty of these poems (especially the latter) is its weakness: it is possible that the mind of the reader, lost in the sensuous, nay! even in the moral beauty of the words, may fail to be impressed by their most important meaning.  Shelley himself recognised this later: hence the direct and simple vigour of the "Masque of Anarchy."
  It has often puzzled athiests how a man of Milton's genius could have written as he did of Christianity.  But we must not forget that Milton lived immediately after the most important Revolution in Religion and Politics of modern times: Shelley on the brink of such another Political upheaval. Shakespeare alone sat enthroned above it all like a god, and is not lost in the mire of controversy.<<So it is usually supposed.  Maybe I shall one day find words to combat, perhaps to overthrow, this position.  "P.S." As, for example, page 185.  As a promise-keeper I am the original eleven stone three Peacherine. -- A.C.>>  This also, though "I'm no Shakespeare, as too probable," I have endeavoured to avoid: yet I cannot but express the hope that my own enquiries into religion may be the reflection of the spirit of the age; and that plunged as we are in the midst of jingoism and religious revival, we may be standing on the edge of some gigantic precipice, over which we may cast all our impedimenta of lies and trickeries, political, social, moral, and religious, and (ourselves) take wings and fly.  The comparison between myself and the masters of English thought I have named is unintentional, though perhaps unavoidable; and though the presumption is, of course, absurd, yet a straw will show which way the wind blows as well as the most beautiful and elaborate vane: and in this sense it is my most eager hope that I may not unjustly draw a comparison between myself and the great reformers of eighty years ago.  {143A}
  I must apologise (perhaps) for the new note of frivolity in my work: due doubtless to the frivolity of my subject: these poems being written when I was an Advaitist and could not see why -- everything being an illusion -- there should be any particular object in doing or thinking anything.  How I have found the answer will be evident from my essay on this subject.<<"Vide infra," "Berashith.">>  I must indeed apologise to the illustrious Shade of Robert Browning for my audacious parody in title, style, and matter of his "Christmas Eve and Easter Day."  The more I read it the eventual anticlimax of that wonderful poem irritated me only the more.  But there is hardly any poet living or dead who so commands alike my personal affection and moral admiration.  My desire to find the Truth will be my pardon with him, whose whole life was spent in admiration of Truth, though he never turned its formidable engines against the Citadel of the Almighty.
  If I be appealed of blasphemy or irreverence in my treatment of these subjects, I will take refuge in Browning's own apology, from the very poem I am attacking:

      "I have done: and if any blames me,
    Thinking that merely to touch in brevity
      The topics I dwell on were unlawful --
    Or worse, that I trench with undue levity
      On the bounds of the holy and the awful --
    I praise the heart and pity the head of him
      And refer myself to Thee, instead of him,
    Who head and heart alike discernest,
      Looking below light speech we utter
    Where frothy spume and frequent splutter
      Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest!"

  But I have after all little fear that I am seriously wrong.  That I show to my critics the open door of the above city of refuge may be taken as merely another gesture of contemptuous pity, the last insult which may lead my antagonists to that surrender which is the truest victory.

                 One ageless anguish filled my days
                 So that no item, like a star
                 Sole in the supreme night, above
                 Stands up for hope, or joy, or love.                      685
                 Nay, not one ignis fatuus glides
                 Sole in that marsh, one agony
                 To make the rest look light.  Abides
                 The thick sepulchral changeless shape
                 Shapeless, continuous misery                              690
                 Whereof no smoke-wreaths might escape
                 To show me whither lay the end,
                 Whence the beginning.  All is black,
                 Void of all cause, all aim; unkenned,
                 As if I had been dead indeed --                           695
                 All in Christ's name!  And I look back,
                 And then and long time after lack
                 Courage or strength to hurl the creed
                 Down to the heaven it sprang from!  No!
                 Not this inspires the indignant blow          700  {PAGE 161}

                 Filled with those innocent agonies
                 Of Pagan Martyrs that once bled,
                 Of Christian Martyrs damned and dead
                 In inter-Christian bickerings,                            705

                 Nor do I cry the scoffer's cry,                           710
                 That Christians live and look the lie
                 Their faith has taught them: none of these
                 Inspire my life, distrub my peace.
                 I go beneath the outward faith
                 Find it a devil or a wrath,                               715

                 Kissing the universe its rod,

Some poetry.     There is a lake<<1>>  amid the snows
                 Wherein five glaciers merge and break.                    420
                 Oh! the deep brilliance of the lake!
                 The roar of ice that cracks and goes
                 Crashing within the water!  Glows
                 The pale pure water, shakes and slides
                 The glittering sun through emerald tides,                 425
                 So that faint ripples of young light
                 Laugh on the green.  Is there a night {PAGE 174}
                 So still and cold, a frost so chill,
                 That all the glaciers be still?
                 Yet in its peace no frost.                                430
<<1. This simile for the mind and its impressions, which must be stilled before the sun of the soul can be reflected, is common in Hindu literature. The five glaciers are, of course, the senses.>>
                                          Arise!
                 Over the mountains steady stand,
                 O sun of glory, in the skies
                 Alone, above, unmoving!  Brand
                 Thy sigil, thy resistless might,                          435
                 The abundant imminence of light!
                 Ah!
                       O in the silence, in the dark,
                 In the intangible, unperfumed,
                 Ingust abyss, abide and mark                              440
                 The mind's magnificence assumed
                 In the soul's splendour!  Here is peace;
                 Here earnest of assured release.
                 Here is the formless all-pervading
                 Spirit of the World, rising, fading                       445
                 Into a glory subtler still.
                 Here the intense abode of Will
                 Closes its gates, and in the hall
                 Is solemn sleep of festival.
                 Peace!  Peace!  Silence of peace!                         450
                 O visionless abode!  Cease!  Cease!
                 Through the dark veil press on!  The veil
                 Is rent asunder, the stars pale,
                 The suns vanish, the moon drops,
                 The chorus of the spirit stops,                           455

                 But never think I shall appeal
                 To Gods.  What folly can compare
                 With such stupidity as prayer?                            555

Marvellous an-   some years ago I thought to try
swer to prayer.  Prayer{#51} -- test its efficacity.
Prayer and       I fished by a Norwegian lake.
averages.        "O God," I prayed, "for Jesus' sake
                 Grant thy poor servant all his wish!                      560
                 For every prayer produce a fish!"
                 Nine times the prayer went up the spout,
                 And eight times -- what a thumping trout!
                 (This is the only true fish-story
                 I ever heard -- give God the glory!)                      565
                 The thing seems cruel now, of course.
                 Still, it's a grand case of God's force!
                 But, modern Christians, do you dare
                 With common prudence to compare
                 The efficacity of prayer?                                 570
                 Who will affirm of Christian sages
                 That prayer can alter averages?
                 The individual case allows
                 Some chance to operate, and thus
                 Destroys its value quite for us.                          575
                 So that is why I knit my brows
                 And think -- and find no thing to say
                 Or do, so foolish as to pray.

                               AN APPRECIATION

                           BY ALEISTER CROWLEY.<<1>>

<<1. The lamented decease of the above gentleman forbids all hope (save through the courtesy of Sir Oliver Lodge) of the appearance of the companion article. -- A.C.>>

IT is a lamentable circumstance that so many colossal brains (W. H. Mallock, &c.) have been hitherto thrown away in attacking what is after all a problem of mere academic interest, the authorship of the plays our fathers accepted as those of Shakespeare.  To me it seems of immediate and vital importance to do for Shakespeare what Verrall has done so ably for Euripides.  The third tabernacle must be filled; Shaw and "the Human" must have their Superhuman companion.  (This is not a scale: pithecanthropoid innuendo is to deprecated.)
   Till now -- as I write the sun bursts forth suddenly from a cloud, as if heralding the literary somersault of the twentieth century -- we have been content to accept Shakespeare as orthodox, with common sense; moral to a fault, with certain Rabelaisian leanings: a healthy tone (we say) pervades his work.  Never believe it!  The sex problem is his Speciality; a morbid decadence (so-called) is hidden i' th' heart o' th' rose.  In other words, the divine William is the morning star to Ibsen's dawn, and Bernard Shaw's effulgence.
   The superficial, the cynical, the misanthropic will demand proof of such a statement.  Let it be our contemptuous indulgence to afford them what they ask.
   May I premise that, mentally obsessed, monomaniac indeed, as we must now consider Shakespeare to have been on these points, he was yet artful enough to have concealed his {185A} advanced views -- an imperative necessity, if we consider the political situation, and the virginal mask under which Queen Bess hid the grotesque and hideous features of a Messaline.  Clearly so, since but for this concealment even our Shakespearian scholars would have discovered so patent a fact.  In some plays, too, of course, the poet deals with less dangerous topics.  These are truly conventional, no doubt; we may pass them by; they are foreign to our purpose; but we will take that stupendous example of literary subterfuge -- "King Lear."<<WEH NOTE:  All this is very well, and fun; but Crowley overlooks the obvious fact that Shakespeare wrote this play as propaganda.  So effective was this "take" on the War of the Roses that it played in very earnest later under the Stuarts with Cromwell!>>
   Let me digress to the history of my own conversion.
   Syllogistically, -- All great men ("e.g." Shaw) are agnostics and subverters of morals.  Shakespeare was a great man.  Therefore Shakespeare was an agnostic and a subverter of morals.
   "A priori" this is then certain.  But --

          Who killed Rousseau?
          I, said Huxley
          (Like Robinson Crusoe),
          With arguments true, -- so
          I killed Rousseau!

   Beware of "a priori!"  Let us find our facts, guided in the search by "a priori" methods, no doubt; but the result will this time justify us.
   Where would a man naturally hide his greatest treasure?  In his most perfect treasure-house.
   Where shall we look for the truest thought of a great poet?  In his greatest poem.
   What is Shakespeare's greatest play?  "King Lear."
   In "King Lear," then, we may expect the final statement of the poet's mind.  The passage that first put me on the track of the amazing discovery for which the world has to thank me is to be found in Act I. Sc. iii. II. 132-149: --
   "This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, -- often the surfeit of our own behaviour, -- we make guilty {185B} of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star!  My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity was under "ursa major;" so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.  'Sfoot!  I should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkeled on my bastardizing."
   If there is one sound philosophical dictum in the play, it is this.  (I am not going to argue with astrologers in the twentieth century.)
   It is one we can test.  On questions of morality and religion opinions veer; but if Shakespeare was a leader of thought, he saw through the humbug of the star-gazers; if not, he was a credulous fool; not the one man of his time, not a "debauched genius" (for Sir R. Burton in this phrase has in a sense anticipated me discovery) but a mere Elizabethan.
   This the greatest poet of all time?  Then we must believe that Gloucester was right, and that eclipses caused the fall of Lear!  Observe that before this Shakespeare has had a sly dig or two at magic.  In "King John," "My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night" -- but there is no eyewitness.  So in "Macbeth."  In a host of spiritual suggestion there is always the rational sober explanation alongside to discredit the folly of the supernatural.
   Shakespeare is like his own touchstone; he uses his folly as a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
   Here, however, the mask is thrown off for any but the utterly besotted; Edmund's speech stands up in the face of all time as truth; it challenges the acclamation of the centuries.
  Edmund is then the hero; more, he is Shakespeare's own portrait of himself; his ways are dark -- (and, alas! his tricks are vain!) -- for why?  For the fear of the conventional world about him.
   He is illegitimate: Shakespeare is no true child of that age, but born in defiance of it and its prejudices.
   Having taken this important step, let us slew round the rest of the play to fit it.  If it fits, the law of probability comes to our aid; every coincidence multiplies the chance of our correctness in ever increasing proportion.  We shall see -- and you may look up your Proctor -- that if the stars are placed just so by chance not law, then also it may be possible that Shakespeare was the wool-combing, knock-kneed, camel-backed, church-going, plaster-of-Paris, {186A} stick-in-the-mud our scholars have always made him.
   Edmund being the hero, Regan and Goneril must be the heroines.  So nearly equal are their virtues and beauties that our poet cannot make up his mind which shall possess him -- besides which, he wishes to drive home his arguments in favour of polygamy.
   But the great theme of the play is of course filial duty; on this everything will turn.  Here is a test:
   "Whenever this question is discussed, let us see who speaks the language of sense, and who that of draggle-tailed emotionalism and tepid melodrama."
   In the first scene the heroines, who do not care for the old fool their father -- as how could any sane women?  Remember Shakespeare is here about to show the folly of filal love as such -- feel compelled, by an act of gracious generosity to a man they despise, yet pity, to say what they think will please the dotard's vanity.  Also no doubt the sound commercial instinct was touched by Lear's promise to make acres vary as words, and they determined to make a final effort to get some parsnips buttered after all.
   Shakespeare (it is our English boast) was no long-haired squiggle self-yclept bard; but a business man -- see Bishop Blougram's appreciation of him as such.
   Shall we suppose him to have deliberately blackguarded in another his own best qualities?
   Note, too, the simple honesty of the divine sisters!  Others, more subtle, would have suspected a trap, arguing that such idiocy as Lear's could not be genuine -- Cordelia, the Madame Humbert of the play, does so; her over-cleverness leaves her stranded: yet by a certain sliminess of dissimulation, the oilness of frankness, the pride that apes humility, she "does" catch the best king going.  Yet it avails her little.  She is hanged like the foul Vivien she is.<<I use the word Vivien provisionally, pending the appearance of an essay to prove that Lord Tennyson was in secret an ardent reformer of our lax modern morals.  No doubt, there is room for this.  Vivien was perfectly right about the "cycle of strumpets and scoundrels whom Mr. Tennyson has set revolving round the figure of his central wittol," and she was the only one with the courage to say so, and the brains to strip off the barbarous glitter from an idiotic and phantom chivalry.>>
   Cordelia's farewell to her sisters shows up the characters of the three in strong relief.  Cordelia -- without a scrap of evidence to go on  -- accuses her sisters of hypocrisy and cruelty.  (This could not have previously existed, or Lear would not have been deceived.)
   Regan gravely rebukes her; recommends, as it were, a course of Six Easy Lessons in Minding {186B} Her Own Business; and surely it was unparalleled insolence of the part of a dismissed girl to lecture her more favoured sister on the very point for which she herself was at that moment being punished.  It is the spite of baffled dissimulation against triumphant honesty.  Goneril adds a word of positive advice.  "You," she says in effect, "who prate of duty thus, see you show it to him unto whom you owe it."
   That this advice is wasted is clear from Act V. Sc. iii., where the King of France takes the first trivial opportunity<<He leaves her in charge of Marshal Le Fer, whom alone he could trust to be impervious to her wiles, he being devoted to another; for, as an invaluable contemporary MS. has it, "Seccotine colle meme Le Fer.">> to be free of the vile creature he had so foolishly married.
   Cordelia goes, and the sisters talk together.  Theirs is the language of quiet sorrow for an old man's failing mind; yet a most righteous determination not to allow the happiness of the English people to depend upon his whims.  Bad women would have rejoiced in the banishment of Kent, whom they already knew to be their enemy; these truly good women regret it.  "Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment" (Act I. Sc. i, ll 304-5).
   In Scene ii. Edmund is shown; he feels himself a man, more than Edgar: a clear-headed, brave, honourable man; but with no maggots.  The injustice of his situation strikes him; he determines not to submit.<<This may be, but I think should not be, used as an argument to prove the poet an illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth.>>
   This is the attitude of a strong man, and a righteous one.  Primogeniture is wrong enough; the other shame, no fault of his, would make the blood of any free man boil.
   Gloucester enters, and exhibits himself as a prize fool by shouting in disjointed phrases what everybody knew.  Great news it is, of course, and on discovering Edmund, he can think of nothing more sensible than to ask for more!  "Kent banished thus!  And France in choler parted!  And the king gone to-night! subscrib'd his power!  Confin'd to exhibition!  All this done upon the gad!  Edmund, how now! what news?"  (Act I. Sc. ii. ll. 23-26).
   Edmund "forces a card" by the simple device of a prodigious hurry to hide it.  Gloucester gives vent to his astrological futilities, and falls to anxiomania in its crudest form, -- "We have seen the best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves" (Sc. ii. ll. 125-127).
   Edmund, once rid of him, gives us the {187A} plainest sense we are likely to hear for the rest of our lives; then, with the prettiest humour in the world takes the cue of his father's absurdity, and actually plays it on his enemy.  Edgar's leg is not so easily pulled -- ("How long have you been a sectary astronomical?"  ll. 169, 170) -- and the bastard hero, taking alarm gets right down to business.
   In Scene iii. we find Lear's senile dementia taking the peculiarly loathsome forms familiar to alienists -- this part of my subject is so unpleasant that I must skim over it; I only mention it to show how anxious Shakespeare is to show his hidden meaning, otherwise his naturally delicate mind would have avoided the depiction of such phenomena.
   All this prepares us for Scene iv., in which we get a glimpse of the way Lear's attendants habitually behave.  Oswald, who treats Lear throughout with perfect respect, and only shows honest independence in refusing to obey a man who is not his master, is insulted in language worthier of a bargee than a king; and when he remonstrates in dignified and temperate language is set upon by the ruffanly Kent.
   Are decent English people to complain when Goneril insists that this of thing shall not occur in a royal house?  She does so, in language nobly indignant, yet restrained: Lear, in the hideous, impotent rage of senility, calls her -- his own daughter  -- a bastard (no insult to her, but to himself or his wife, mark ye well!).  Albany enters -- a simple, orderly-minded man; he must not be confused with Cornwall, he is at the last Lear's dog; yet even he in decent measured speech sides with his wife.  Is Lear quieted?  No!  He utters the most horrible curse, not excepting that of Count Cenci, that a father ever pronounced.  Incoherent threats succeed to the boilings-over of the hideous malice of a beastly mind; but a hundred knights are a hundred knights, and a threat is a threat.  Goneril had not fulfilled her duty to herself, to her people, had she allowed this monster of mania to go on.
   I appeal to the medical profession; of one doctor will answer me that a man using Lear's language should be allowed control of a hundred armed ruffians [in the face of Kent's behaviour we know what weight to attach to Lear's defence: "Detested kite! thou liest" (I. iv. l. 286)], should ever be allowed outside a regularly appointed madhouse, I will cede the point, and retire myself into an asylum.
   In fact, Lear is going mad; the tottering intellect, at no time strong ("tis the infirmity of age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself," I. i. ll. 296-7), is utterly cast down by drink and debauchery: he even sees it himself, and with a pointless bestiality from the Fool, fit companion for the -- king -- and in that word {187B} we see all the concentrated loathing of the true Shakespeare for a despotism, massed in one lurid flame, phantasmagoric horror, the grim First Act rolls down.

                                     II.

   Act II. Sc. i. adds little new to our thesis, save that in line 80 we see Gloucester (ignorant of his own son's handwriting!) accept the forged letter as genuine, as final proof, with not even the intervention of a Bertillon to excuse so palpable a folly, so egregious a crime.  What father of to-day would disinherit, would hunt down to death, a beloved son, on such evidence?  Or are we to take it that the eclipse gave proof unshakable of a phenomenon so portentous?
   In Scene ii. we have another taste of Kent's gentlemanly demeanour; let our conventionalist interpreters defend this unwarrantable bullying if they dare! Another might be so gross, so cowardly; but not our greatest poet!  A good portion of this play, as will be shown later, is devoted to a bitter assault upon the essentially English notion that the pugilist is the supreme device of the Creator for furthering human happiness.  (See "Cashel Byron's Profession" for a similar, though more logical and better-worded, attack.)  Coarse and violent language continues to disgrace Lear's follower; only Gloucester, the unconscionable ass and villain of Scene i., has a word to say in his defence.
   In Scene iii. we have a taste of Edgar's quality.  Had this despicable youth the consciousness of innocence, or even common courage, he had surely stood to his trial.  Not he!  He plays the coward's part -- and his disguise is not even decent.
   In Scene iv. we are shown the heroic sisters in their painful task of restraining, always with the utmost gentleness of word and demeanour, the headstrong passions of the miserable king.  Lear, at first quiet in stating his fancied wrongs "Reg." 'I am glad to see your highness.'  "Lear." 'Regan, I think you are; I know what reason I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb, Sepulchring an adult'ress.  ("to Kent").  O! are you free?  Some other time for that.  Beloved Regan, Thy sister's naught: O Regan! she hath tied Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here: ("Points to his heart").  I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe with how deprav'd a quality -- O Regan!'  "Reg." 'I pray you, sir, take patience.  I have hope!'") (ll. 130-139), an excusable speech, at the first hint that he is not to have it all his own way, falls a-cursing again like the veriest drab or scullion Hamlet ever heard.
   Here is a man, deprived on just cause of {188A} half a useless company of retainers.  Is this wrong (even were it wrong) such as to justify the horrible curses of ll. 164-168.  "All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top!  Strike her young bones, You taking airs, with lameness!  You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes!"  With this he makes his age contemptible by the drivel-pathos of ll. 156-158, "Dear daughter, I confess that I am old; Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg ('Keeling') That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food," begging what none ever thought to deny him.
   Yet such is the patience of Goneril that even when goaded by all this infamous Billingsgate into speech, her rebuke is the temperate and modest ll. 198-200.  "Why not by the hand, sir?  How have I offended?  All's not offence that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so."  If we ask a parallel for such meekness under insult, calumny, and foul abuse, we must seek it not in a human story, but a divine.
   The heroines see that no half measures will do, and Lear is stripped of all the murderous retinue -- what scum they are is shown by the fact that not one of them draws sword for him, or even follows him into the storm -- for him in spite of all his loathsomeness, his hatred, his revengefulness -- is Regan's gentle and loving,
       "For his particular, I'll receive him gladly."

                                     III.

  In Act III. we have another illustration of the morality that passed current with the Tudors, and which only a Shakespeare had the courage to attack.  Kent does not stick at treachery -- he makes one gulp of treason -- straining at the gnat of discipline, he swallows the camel of civil war.
   It was then, and is even now, the practice of some -- for example, the emigres of the French Revolution -- to invite foreign invasion as a means of securing domestic reaction.  The blackguardism implied is beyond language: Shakespeare was perhaps thinking of the proposal, in Mary's reign, to react to Romanism by the aid of Spanish troops.  But he will go further than this, will our greatest poet; it were ill that the life of even one child should atone for mere indignity or discomfort to another, were he the greatest in the realm.  To-day, we all agree; we smile or sneer if any one should differ.
   "King Lear got caught in the rain -- let us go and kill a million men!" is an argument not much understood of Radical Clubs, and even Jingos would pause, did they but take the precaution of indulging in a mild aperient before recording their opinions.  {188B}
   In Scenes iii., vi., and vii., Edmund, disguised beyond all measure with Gloucester's infamies, honourably and patriotically denounces him.
   The other scenes depict the miseries which follow the foolish and the unjust; and Nemesis falls upon the ill-minded Gloucester.  Yet Shakespeare is so appreciative of the virtue of compassion (for Shakespeare was, as I shall hope to prove one day, a Buddhist) that Cornwall, the somewhat cruel instrument of eternal Justice, is killed by his servant.  Regan avenges her husband promptly, and I have little doubt that this act of excessive courtesy towards a man she did not live is the moral cause of her unhappy end.
   I would note that we should not attempt to draw any opinions as to the author's design from the conversation of the vulgar; even had we not Cariolanus to show us what he thought.

                                     IV.

   Act IV. develops the plot and is little germaine to our mater, save that we catch a glimpse of the unspeakably vile Cordelia, with no pity for her father's serious condition (though no doubt he deserved all he got, he was now harmless, and should have inspired compassion), hanging to him in the hope that he would now reverse his banishment and make her (after a bloody victory) sole heiress of great England.
   And were any doubt left in our minds as to who really was the hero of the play, the partizanship of France should settle it.  Shakespeare has never any word but ridicule for the French; never aught but praise of England and love for her: are we to suppose that in his best play he is to stultify all his other work and insult the English for the benefit of the ridiculed and hated Frenchman?
   Moreover, Cordelia reckons without her host.  The British bulldogs make short work of the invaders and rebels, doubtless with the connivance of the King of France, who, with great and praiseworthy acuteness, foresees that Cordelia will be hanged, thus liberating him from his "most filthy bargain": there is but one alarum, and the whole set of scoundrels surrender.  Note this well; it is not by brute force that the battle is won; for even if we exonerate the King of France, we may easily believe that the moral strength of the sisters cowed the French.
   This is the more evident, since in Act V. Shakespeare strikes his final blow at the absurdity of the duel, when Edmund is dishonestly slain by the beast Edgar.  Yet the poet's faith is still strong: wound up as his muse is to tragedy, he retains in Edmund the sublime heroism, the simple honesty, of the {189A} true Christian; at the death of his beloved mistress he cries,
       "I was contracted to them both: all three
        Now marry in an instant -- "
   At the moment of death his great nature (self-accusatory, as the finest so often are) asserts itself, and he forgives even the vilest of the human race, -- "I pant for life: some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature.<<This may merely mean "despite the fact that I am dying -- though I am almost too weak to speak."  If so, the one phrase in the play which seems to refute our theory is disposed of.  Execution of such criminals would be a matter of routine at the period of the play.>>  Quickly send, Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.  Nay, send in time" (ll. 245-249).
   And in that last supreme hour of agony he claims Regan as his wife, as if by accident; it is not the passionate assertion of a thing doubtful, but the natural reference to a thing well known and indisputable.
   And in the moment of his despair; confronted with the dead bodies of the splendid sisters, the catafalque of all his hopes, he can exclaim in spiritual triumph over material disaster -- the victory of a true man's spirit over Fate --
       "Yet Edmund was beloved."
   Edgar is left alive with Albany, alone of all that crew; and if remorse could touch their brutal and callous souls (for the degeneration of the weakling, well-meaning Albany, is a minor tragedy), what hell could be more horrible than the dragging out of a cancerous existence in the bestial world of hate their hideous hearts had made, now, even for better men, for ever dark and gloomy, robbed of the glory of the glowing Goneril, the royal Regan, and only partially redeemed by the absence of the harlot Cordelia and the monster Lear.

                                      V.

   It may possibly be objected by the censorious, by the effete parasites of a grim conventionalism, that I have proved too much.  Even by conventional standards Edmund, Goneril, and Regan appear angels.  Even on the moral point, the sisters, instead of settling down to an enlightened and by no means overcrowded polygamy, prefer to employ poison.  This is perhaps true, of Goneril at least; Regan is, if one may distinguish between star and star, somewhat the finer character.
   This criticism is perhaps true in part; but I will not insult the intelligence of my readers.  I will leave it to them to take the obvious step and work backwards to the re-exaltation of Lear, Cordelia, Edgar and company, to the heroic fields of their putty Elysium (putty, not {189B} Putney) in their newly-demonstrated capacity as "unnatural" sons, daughters, fathers, and so on.
   But I leave it.  I am content -- my work will have been well done -- if this trifling essay be accepted as a just installment towards a saner criticism of our holiest writers, a juster appreciation of the glories of our greatest poet, a {190A upper column breaks} possibility jejune yet assuredly historic attempt to place for the first time William Shakespeare on his proper pedestal as an early disciple of Mr. George Bernard Shaw; and by consequence to carve myself a little niche in the same temple: the smallest contributions will be thankfully received. {190B upper column breaks out to full page for one line.}

<<1. WEH NOTE:  This essay may have been inspired by Blake's argument between Satan and the Archangel -- whereby Satan demonstrates that Christ broke every one of the Ten Commandments.>>

   Unwilling as I am to sap the foundations of the Buddhist religion by the introduction of Prophyry's terrible catapult, Allegory.  I am yet compelled by the more fearful ballista of Aristotle, Dilemma.  This is the two-handed engine spoken of by the prophet Milton!<<"Lycidas," line 130.>>
   This is the horn of the prophet Zeruiah, and with this am I, though no Syrian, utterly pushed, till I find myself back against the dead wall of Dogma.  Only now realising how dead a wall that is, do I turn and try the effect of a hair of the dog that bit me, till the orthodox "literary"<<The school whose Buddhism is derived from the Canon, and who ignore the degradation of the professors of the religion, as seen in practice.>> school of Buddhists, as grown at Rangoon, exclaim with Lear: "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have an intellect!"  How is this?  Listen, and hear!
   I find myself confronted with the crux: that, a Buddhist, convinced intellectually and philosophically of the truth of the teaching of Gotama; a man to whom Buddhism is the equivalent of scientific methods of Thought; an expert in dialectic, whose logical faculty is bewildered, whose critical admiration is extorted by the subtle vigour of Buddhist reasoning; I am yet forced to admit that, this being so, the Five Precepts<<The obvious caveat which logicians will enter against these remarks is that Pansil is the Five Virtues rather than Precepts.  Etymologically this is so.  However, we may regard this as a clause on my side of the argument, not against it; for in my view these are virtues, and the impossibility of attaining them is the cancer of existence.  Indeed, I support the etymology as against the futile bigotry of certain senile Buddhists of to-day.  And, since it is the current interpretation of Buddhistic thought that I attack, I but show myself the better Buddhist in the act. -- A. C.>> are mere nonsense.  If the Buddha spoke scientifically, not popularly, not rhetorically, then his precepts are not his.  We must reject them or we must interpret them.  We must inquire: Are they meant to be obeyed?  Or -- and this is my theory -- are they sarcastic and biting criticisms on existence, illustrations of the First Noble Truth; "reasons," as it were, for the apotheosis of annihilation?  I shall show that this is so.  Let me consider them "precept upon precept," if the introduction of the Hebrew visionary is not too strong meat for the Little Mary<<A catch word for the stomach, from J. M. Barrie's play "Little Mary.">> of a Buddhist audience. {192B}

                THE FIRST PRECEPT.

   This forbids the taking of life in any form.<<Fielding, in "The soul of a People," has reluctantly to confess that he can find no trace of this idea in Buddha's own work, and calls the superstition the "echo of an older Faith." -- A. C.>>  What we have to note is the impossibility of performing this; if we can prove it to be so, either Buddha was a fool, or his command was rhetorical, like those of Yahweh to Job, or of Tannhauser to himself --

  "Go! seek the stars and count them and explore!
   Go! sift the sands beyond a starless sea!"

   Let us consider what the words can mean.  The "Taking of Life" can only mean the reduction of living protoplasm to dead matter: or, in a truer and more psychological sense, the destruction of personality.
   Now, in the chemical changes involved in Buddha's speaking this command, living protoplasm was changed into dead matter.  Or, on the other horn, the fact (insisted upon most strongly by the Buddha himself, the central and cardinal point of his doctrine, the shrine of that Metaphysic which isolates it absolutely from all other religious metaphysic, which allies it with Agnostic Metaphysic) that the Buddha who had spoken this command was not the same as the Buddha before he had spoken it, lies the proof that the Buddha, by speaking this command, violated it.  More, not only did he slay himself; he breathed in millions of living organisms and slew them.  He could nor eat nor drink nor breathe without murder implicit in each act.  Huxley cites the "pitiless microscopist" who showed a drop of water to the Brahmin who boasted himself "Ahimsa" -- harmless.  So among the "rights" of a Bhikkhu is medicine.  He who takes quinine does so with the deliberate intention of destroying innumerable living beings; whether this is done by stimulating the phagocytes, or directly, is morally indifferent.
   How such a fiend incarnate, my dear brother Ananda Maitriya, can call him "cruel and cowardly" who only kills a tiger, is a study in the philosophy of the mote and the beam!<<The argument that the "animals are our brothers" is merely intended to mislead one who has never been in a Buddhist country.  The average Buddhist would, of course, kill his brother for five rupees, or less. -- A. C. {WEH NOTE: This footnote is left floating at the bottom of the page without a text referent. Probably it goes here, with a typo in the form of an exclamation mark replacing the dagger that would have drawn it to this point.}>>
   Far be it from me to suggest that this is a defence of breathing, eating, and drinking.  By no means; in all these ways we bring suffering and death to others, as to ourselves.  But since these are inevitable acts, since suicide would be a still more cruel alternative (especially in case something should subsist below mere Rupa), the command is not to achieve {192B} the impossible, the already violated in the act of commanding, but a bitter commentary on the foul evil of this aimless, hopeless universe, this compact of misery, meanness, and cruelty.  Let us pass on.

               THE SECOND PRECEPT.

   The Second Precept is directed against theft.  Theft is the appropriation to one's own use of that to which another has a right.  Let us see therefore whether or no the Buddha was a thief.  The answer of course is in the affirmative.  For to issue a command is to attempt to deprive another of his most precious possession -- the right to do as he will; that is, unless, with the predestinarians, we hold that action is determined absolutely, in which case, of course, a command is as absurd as it is unavoidable.  Excluding this folly, therefore, we may conclude that if the command be obeyed -- and those of Buddha have gained a far larger share of obedience than those of any other teacher -- the Enlightened One was not only a potential but an actual thief. Further, all voluntary action limits in some degree, however minute, the volition of others.  If I breathe, I diminish the stock of oxygen available on the planet.  In those far distant ages when Earth shall be as dead as the moon is to-day, my breathing now will have robbed some being then living of the dearest necessity of life.
   That the theft is minute, incalculably trifling, is no answer to the moralist, to whom degree is not known; nor to the scientist, who sees the chain of nature miss no link.
   If, on the other hand, the store of energy in the universe be indeed constant (whether infinite or no), if personality be indeed delusion, then theft becomes impossible, and to forbid it is absurd.  We may argue that even so temporary theft may exist; and that this is so is to my mind no doubt the case.  All theft is temporary, since even a millionaire must die; also it is universal, since even a Buddha must breathe.

                THE THIRD PRECEPT.

   This precept, against adultery, I shall touch but lightly.  Not that I consider the subject unpleasant -- far from it! -- but since the English section of my readers, having unclean minds, will otherwise find a fulcrum therein for their favourite game of slander.  Let it suffice if I say that the Buddha -- in spite of the ridiculous membrane legend,<<Membrum virile illius in membrana inclusum esse aiunt, ne copulare posset.>> one of those foul follies which idiot devotees invent only too freely -- was a confirmed and habitual adulterer.  It {193A} would be easy to argue with Hegel-Huxley that he who thinks of an act commits it ("cf." Jesus also in this connection, though he only knows the creative value of desire), and that since A and not-A are mutually limiting, therefore interdependent, therefore identical, he who forbids an act commits it; but I feel that this is no place for metaphysical hair-splitting; let us prove what we have to prove in the plainest way.
   I would premise in the first place that to commit adultery in the divorce Court sense is not here in question.
   It assumes too much proprietary right of a man over a woman, that root of all abomination! -- the whole machinery of inheritance, property, and all the labyrinth of law.
   We may more readily suppose that the Buddha was (apparently at least) condemning incontinence.
   We know that Buddha had abandoned his home; true, but Nature has to be reckoned with.  Volition is no necessary condition of offence.  "I didn't mean to" is a poor excuse for an officer failing to obey an order.
   Enough of this -- in any case a minor question; since even on the lowest moral grounds -- and we, I trust, soar higher! -- the error in question may be resolved into a mixture of murder, theft, and intoxication.  (We consider the last under the Fifth Precept.)

               THE FOURTH PRECEPT.

   Here we come to what in a way is the fundamental joke of these precepts.  A command is not a lie, of course; possibly cannot be; yet surely an allegorical order is one in essence, and I have no longer a shadow of a doubt that these so-called "precepts" are a species of savage practical joke.
   Apart from this there can hardly be much doubt, when critical exegesis has done its damnedest on the Logia of our Lord, that Buddha did at some time commit himself to some statement.  "(Something called) Consciousness exists" is, said Huxley, the irreducible minimum of the pseudo-syllogism, false even for an enthymeme, "Cogito, ergo sum!"  This proposition he bolsters up by stating that whoso should pretend to doubt it, would thereby but confirm it. Yet might it not be said "(something called) Consciousness appears to itself to exist," since Consciousness is itself the only witness to that confirmation?  Not that even now we can deny some kind of existence to consciousness, but that it should be a more real existence than that of a reflection is doubtful, incredible, even inconceivable.  If by consciousness we mean the normal consciousness, it is definitely untrue, since the {193B} Dhyanic consciousness includes it and denies it.  No doubt "something called" acts as a kind of caveat to the would-be sceptic, though the phrase is bad, implying a "calling."  But we can guess what Huxley means.
   No doubt Buddha's scepticism does not openly go quite as far as mine -- it must be remembered that "scepticism" is merely the indication of a possible attitude, not a belief, as so many good fool folk think; but Buiddha not only denies "Cogito, ergo sum"; but "Cogito, ergo non sum."  See "Sabbasava Sutta." par. 10.<<Quoted below, "Science and Buddhism," note.>>
   At any rate Sakkyaditthi, the delusion of personality, is in the very forefront of his doctrines; and it is this delusion that is constantly and inevitably affirmed in all normal consciousness.  That Dhyanic thought avoids it is doubtful; even so, Buddha is here represented as giving precepts to ordinary people.  And if personality be delusion, a lie is involved in the command of one to another.  In short, we all lie all the time; we are compelled to it by the nature of things themselves -- paradoxical as that seems -- and the Buddha knew it!

                THE FIFTH PRECEPT.

   At last we arrive at the end of our weary journey -- surely in this weather we may have a drink!  East of Suez,<<"Ship me somewhere East of Suez, where a man can raise a thirst." -- R. KIPLING.>> Trombone-Macaulay (as I may surely say, when Browning writes Banjo-Byron<<"While as for Quip Hop o' my Thumb there, Banjo-Byron that twangs the strum-strum there." -- BROWNING, "Pachiarotto" (said of A. Austin).>>) tells us, a man may raise a Thirst.  No, shrieks the Blessed One, the Perfected One, the Enlightened One, do not drink!  It is like the streets of Paris when they were placarded with rival posters --

          Ne buvez pas de l'Alcool!
          L'Alcool est un poison!
and
          Buvez de l'Alcool!
          L'Alccol est un aliment!

We know now that alcohol is a food up to a certain amount; the precept, good enough for a rough rule as it stands, will not bear close inspection.  What Buddha really commands, with that grim humour of his, is: Avoid Intoxication.
   But what is intoxication? unless it be the loss of power to use perfectly a truth-telling set of faculties.  If I walk unsteadily it is owing to nervous lies -- and so for all the phenomena of drunkenness.  But a lie involves the assumption {194A} of some true standard, and this can nowhere be found.  A doctor would tell you, moreover, that all food intoxicates: all, here as in all the universe, of every subject and in every predicate, is a matter of degree.
   Our faculties never tell us true; our eyes say flat when our fingers say round; our tongue sends a set of impression to our brain which our hearing declares non-existent -- and so on.
   What is this delusion of personality but a profound and centrally-seated intoxication of the consciousness?  I am intoxicated as I address these words; you are drunk -- beastly drunk! -- as you read them; Buddha was as drunk as a British officer when he uttered his besotted command.  There, my dear children, is the conclusion to which we are brought if you insist that he was serious!
   I answer No!  Alone among men then living, the Buddha was sober, and saw Truth.  He, who was freed from the coils of the great serpent Theli coiled round the universe, he knew how deep the slaver of that snake had entered into us, infecting us, rotting our very bones with poisonous drunkenness.  And so his cutting irony -- drink no intoxicating drinks!

                        --

   When I go to take Pansil,<<To "take Pansil" is to vow obedience to these Percepts.>> it is in no spirit of servile morality; it is with keen sorrow gnawing at my heart.  These five causes of sorrow are indeed the heads of the serpent of Desire.  Four at least of them snap their fangs on me in and by virtue of my very act of receiving the commands, and of promising to obey them; if there is a little difficulty about the fifth, it is an omission easily rectified -- and I think we should all make a point about that; there is great virtue in completeness.
   Yes!  Do not believe that the Buddha was a fool; that he asked men to perform the impossible or the unwise.<<I do not propose to dilate on the moral truth which Ibsen has so long laboured to make clear: that no hard and fast rule of life can be universally applicable.  Also, as in the famous case of the lady who saved (successively) the lives of her husband, her father, and her brother, the precepts clash.  To allow to die is to kill -- all this is obvious to the most ordinary thinkers.  These precepts are of course excellent general guides for the vulgar and ignorant, but you and I, dear reader, are wise and clever, and know better.  Nichtwar?
  Excuse my being so buried in "dear Immanuel Kant" (as my friend Miss Br. c.{A.C.SUB NOTE: A fast woman who posed as a bluestocking.} would say) that this biting and pregnant phrase slipped out unaware.  As a rule, of course, I hate the introduction of foreign tongues into an English essay. -- A. C.>>  Do not believe that the sorrow of existence is so trivial that easy rules {194B} easily interpreted (as all Buddhists do interpret the Precepts) can avail against them; do not mop up the Ganges with a duster; nor stop the revolution of the stars with a lever of lath.
   Awake, awake only! let there be ever remembrance that Existence is sorrow, sorrow by the inherent necessity of the way it is made; sorrow not by volition, not by malice, not by carelessness, but by nature, by ineradicable tendency, by the incurable disease of Desire, its Creator, is it so, and the way to destroy it is by uprooting of Desire; nor is a task so formidable accomplished by any threepenny-bit-in-the-plate-on-Sunday morality, the "deceive others and self-deception will take care of itself" uprightness, but by the severe roads of austere self-mastery, of arduous scientific research, which constitute the Noble Eightfold Path.

                    PREFACE<<1>>

<<1. To a collection of MSS. illustrating the "Psychopathia Sexualis" of von Kraft-Ebling.  The names of the parties have been changed.>>

   In the fevered days and nights under the Empire that perished in the struggle of 1870, {195A} that whirling tumult of pleasure, scheming, success, and despair, the minds of men had a trying ordeal to pass through.  In Zola's "La Curee" we see how such ordinary and natural characters as those of Saccard, Maxime, and the incestuous heroine, were twisted and distorted from their normal sanity, and sent whirling into the jaws of a hell far more affryant than the mere cheap and nasty brimstone Sheol which is the Shibboleth for the dissenter, and with which all classes of religious humbug, from the Pope to the Salvation ranter, from the Mormon and the Jesuit to that mongrel mixture of the worst features of both, the Plymouth Brother, have scared their illiterate, since hypocrisy was born, with Abel, and spiritual tyranny, with Jehovah!  Society, in the long run, is eminently sane and practical; under the Second Empire it ran mad.  If these things are done in the green tree of Society, what shall be done in the dry tree of Bohemianism?  Art always has a suspicion to fight against; always some poor mad Max Nordau is handy to call everything outside the kitchen the asylum.  Here, however, there is a substratum of truth.  Consider the intolerable long roll of names, all tainted with glorious madness.  Baudelaire the diabolist, debauchee of sadism, whose dreams are nightmares, and whose waking hours delirium; Rollinat the necrophile, the poet of phthisis, the anxiomaniac; Peladan, the high priest -- of nonsense; Medes, frivolous and scoffing sensualist; besides a host of others, most alike in this, that, below the cloak of madness and depravity, the true heart of genius burns.  No more terrible period than this is to be found in literature; so many great minds, of which hardly one comes to fruition; such seeds of genius, such a harvest of -- whirlwind!  Even a barren waste of sea is less saddening that one strewn with wreckage.
   In England such wild song found few followers of any worth or melody.  Swinburne stands on his solitary pedestal above the vulgar crowds of priapistic plagiarists; he alone caught the fierce frenzy of Baudelaire's brandied shrieks, and his First Series of Poems and Ballads was the legitimate echo of that not fierier note.  But English Art as a whole was unmoved, at any rate not stirred to any depth, by this wave of debauchery.  The great thinkers maintained the even keel, and the windy waters lay not for their frailer barks to cross.  There is one exception of note, till this day unsuspected, in the person of George Archibald Bishop.  In a corner of Paris this young poet (for in his nature the flower of poesy did spring, did even take root and give some promise of a brighter bloom, till stricken and blasted in later years by the lightning of his own sins) was steadily writing day after day, night after {195B} night, often working forty hours at a time, work which he destined to entrance the world.  All England should ring with his praises; by-and-by the whole world should know his name.  Of these works none of the longer and more ambitious remains.  How they were lost, and how those fragments we possess were saved, is best told by relating the romantic and almost incredible story of his life.
   The known facts of this life are few, vague, and unsatisfactory; the more definite statements lack corroboration, and almost the only source at the disposal of the biographer is the letters of Mathilde Doriac to Mdme. J. S., who has kindly placed her portfolio at my service.  A letter dated October 15, 1866, indicates that our author was born on the 23rd of that month.  The father and mother of George were, at least on the surface, of an extraordinary religious turn of mind.  Mathilde's version of the story, which has its source in our friend himself, agrees almost word for word with a letter of the Rev. Edw. Turle to Mrs. Cope, recommending the child to her care.  The substance of the story is as follows.
   The parents of George carried their religious ideas to the point of never consummating their marriage!<<Will it be believed that a clergyman (turned Plymouth Brother and schoolmaster) actually made an identical confession to a boy of ten years old?>>  This arrangement does not seem to have been greatly appreciated by the wife; at least one fine morning she was found to be enceinte.  The foolish father never thought of the hypothesis which commends itself most readily to a man of the world, not to say a man of science, and adopted that of a second Messiah!  He took the utmost pains to conceal the birth of the child, treated everybody who came to the house as an emissary of Herod, and finally made up his mind to flee into Egypt!  Like most religious maniacs, he never had an idea of his own, but distorted the beautiful and edifying events of the Bible into insane and ridiculous ones, which he proceeded to plagiarise.
   On the voyage out the virgin mother became enamoured, as was her wont, of the nearest male, in this case a fellow-traveller.  He, being well able to support her in the luxury which she desired, easily persuaded her to leave the boat with him by stealth.  A small sailing vessel conveyed them to Malta, where they disappeared.  The only trace left in the books of earth records that this fascinating character was accused, four years later, in Vienna, of poisoning her paramour, but thanks to the wealth and influence of her newer lover, she escaped.
   The legal father, left by himself with a squalling child to amuse, to appease in his tantrums, {196A} and to bring up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, was not a little perplexed by the sudden disappearance of his wife.  At first he supposed that she had been translated, but, finding that she had not left the traditional mantle behind her, he abandoned this supposition in favour of quite a different, and indeed a more plausible one.  He now believed her to be the scarlet woman in the Apocalypse, with variations.  On arrival in Egypt he hired an old native nurse, and sailed for Odessa.  Once in Russia he could find Gog and Magog, and present to them the child as Antichrist.  For he was now persuaded that he himself was the First Beast, and would ask the sceptic to count his seven heads and ten horns.  The heads, however, rarely totted up accurately!
   At this point the accounts of Mr. Turle and Mathilde diverge slightly.  The cleric affirms that he was induced by a Tartar lady, of an honourable and ancient profession, to accompany her to Tibet "to be initiated into the mysteries."  He was, of course, robbed and murdered with due punctuality, in the town of Kiev.  Mathilde's story is that he travelled to Kiev on the original quest, and died of typhoid or cholera.  In any case, he died at Kiev in 1839.  This fixes the date of the child's birth at 1837.  His faithful nurse conveyed him safely to England, where his relatives provided for his maintenance and education.
   With the close of this romantic chapter in his early history we lose all reliable traces for some years.  One flash alone illumines the darkness of his boyhood; in 1853, after being prepared for confirmation, he cried out in full assembly, instead of kneeling to receive the blessing of the officiating bishop, "I renounce for ever this idolatrous church;" and was quietly removed.
   He told Mathilde Doriac that he had been to Eton and Cambridge -- neither institution, however, preserves any record of such admission.  The imagination of George, indeed, is tremendously fertile with regard to events in his own life.  His own story is that he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1856, and was sent down two years later for an article which he had contributed to some University or College Magazine.  No confirmation of any sort is to be found anywhere with regard to these or any other statements of our author. There is however, no doubt that in 1861 he quarrelled with his family; went over to Paris, where he settled down, at first, like every tufthead, somewhere in the Quarter Latin; later, with Mathilde Doriac, the noble woman who became his mistress and held to him through all the terrible tragedy of his moral, mental, and physical life, in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere.  At his house there the rightful scene {196B} of '68 took place, and it was there too that he was apprehended after the murders which he describes so faithfully in "Abysmos."  He had just finished this poem with a shriek of triumph, and had read it through to the appalled Mathilde "avec des yeux de flamme et de gestes incoherentes," when foaming at the mouth, and "hurlant de blasphemes indicibles," he fell upon her with extraordinary violence of passion; the door opened, officers appeared, the arrest was effected.  He was committed to an asylum, for there could be no longer any doubt of his complete insanity; for three weeks he had been raving with absinthe and satyriasis.  He survived his confinement no long time; the burning of the asylum with its inmates was one of the most terrible events of the war of 1870.  So died one of the most talented Englishmen of his century, a man who for wide knowledge of men and things was truly to be envied, yet one who sold his birthright for a mess of bestlier pottage than ever Esau guzzled, who sold soul and body to Satan for sheer love of sin, whose mere lust of perversion is so intense that it seems to absorb every other emotion and interest.  Never since God woke light from chaos has such a tragedy been unrolled before men, step after step toward the lake of Fire!
   At his house all his writings were seized, and, it is believed, destroyed.  The single most fortunate exception is that of a superbly jewelled writing- case, now in the possession of the present editor, in which were found the MSS. which are here published.  Mathilde, who knew how he treasured its contents, preserved it by saying to the officer, "But, sir, that is mine."  On opening this it was found to contain, besides these MSS., his literary will.  All MSS. were to be published thirty years after his death, not before.  He would gain no spurious popularity as a reflection of the age he lived in. "Tennyson," he says, "will die before sixty years are gone by: if I am to be beloved of men, it shall be because my work is for all times and all men, because it is greater than all the gods of chance and change, because it has the heart of the human race beating in every line."  This is a patch of magenta to mauve, undoubtedly; but -- !  The present collection of verses will hardly be popular; if the lost works turn up, of course it may be that there may be found "shelter for songs that recede."  Still, even here, one is, on the whole, more attracted than repelled; the author has enormous power, and he never scruples to use it, to drive us half mad with horror, or, as in his earlier most exquisite works, to move us to the noblest thoughts and deeds.  True, his debt to contemporary writers is a little obvious here and there; but these {197A} are small blemishes on a series of poems whose originality is always striking, and often dreadful, in its broader features.
   We cannot leave George Bishop without a word of inquiry as to what became of the heroic figure of Mathilde Doriac.  It is a bitter task to have to write in cold blood the dreadful truth about her death.  She had the misfortune to contract, in the last few days of her life with him, the same terrible disease which he describes in the last poem of his collection.  This shock, coming so soon after, and, as it were, as an unholy perpetual reminder of the madness and sequestration of her lover, no less than of his infidelity, unhinged her mind, and she shot herself on July 5, 1869.  Her last letter to Madame J-- S-- is one of the tenderest and most pathetic ever written.  She seems to have been really loved by George, in his wild, infidel fashion: "All Night" and "Victory," among others, are obviously inspired by her beauty; and her devotion to him, the abasement of soul, the prostitution of body, she underwent for and with him, is one of the noblest stories life has known.  She seems to have dived with him, yet ever trying to raise his soul from the quagmire; if God is just at all, she shall stand more near to His right hand than the vaunted virgins who would soil no hem of vesture to save their brother from the worm that dieth not!
   The Works of George Archibald Bishop will speak for themselves; it would be both impertinent and superfluous in me to point out in detail their many and varied excellences, or their obvious faults.  The "raison d'etre," though, of their publication, is worthy of especial notice.  I refer to their psychological sequence, which agrees with their chronological order.  His life-history, as well as his literary remains, gives us an idea of the progression of diabolism as it really is; not as it is painted.  Note also, (1) the increase of selfishness in pleasure, (2) the diminution of his sensibility to physical charms.  Pure and sane is his early work; then he is carried into the outer current of the great vortex of Sin, and whirls lazily through the sleepy waters of mere sensualism; the pace quickens, he grows fierce in the mysteries of Sapphism and the cult of Venus Aversa with women; later of the same forms of vice with men, all mingled with wild talk of religious dogma and a general exaltation of Priapism at the expense, in particular, of Christianity, in which religion, however, he is undoubtedly a believer till the last (the pious will quote James ii. 19, and the infidel will observe that he died in an asylum); then the full swing of the tide catches him, the mysteries of death become more and more an obsession, and he is flung headlong into Sadism, Necrophilia, {197B} all the maddest, fiercest vices that the mind of fiends ever brought up from the pit.  But always to the very end his power is unexhausted, immense, terrible.  His delirium does not amuse; it appals!  A man who could conceive as he did must himself have had some glorious chord in his heart vibrating to the eternal principle of Boundless Love.  That this love was wrecked is for me, in some sort a relative of his, a real and bitter sorrow.  He might have been so great!  He missed Heaven!  Think kindly of him!

   The above works and many others of less importance were carefully consulted by the Author before passing these lines for the press.  Their substantial accuracy is further guaranteed by the Professors of History at Cambridge, Oxford, Berlin, Harvard, Paris, Moscow, and London. {199A}
   336. "Shot his Chandra."{#56} -- Anglice, shot the moon.
   380. "The subtle devlish omission."{#57} -- But what are we to say of Christian dialecticians who quote "All things work together for good" out of its context, and call this verse "Christian optimism?"  See Caird's "Hegel."
   Hegel knew how to defend himself, though.  As Goethe wrote of him:
   "They thought the master too
    Inclined to fuss and finick.
    The students' anger grew
    To frenzy Paganinic.<<Paganini, a famous violinist.>>
    They vowed to make him rue
    His work in Jena's clinic.
    They came, the unholy crew,
    The mystic and the cynic:
    He had scoffed at God's battue,
    The flood for mortal's sin -- Icthyosaurian Waterloo!
    They eyed the sage askew;
    They searched him through and through
    With violet rays actinic.
    They asked him 'Wer bist du?'
    He answered slowly 'Bin ich?'"
   387. "The Fish."{#58} -- Because of  GR:iota-chi-theta-upsilon-sigma, which means Fish, And very aptly symbolises Christ. -- "Ring and Book" (The Pope), ll. 89, 90.
   395. "Dharma."{#59} -- Consult the Tripitaka.
   409. "I cannot trace the chain."{#60} -- "How vain, indeed, are human calculations!" -- "the Autobiography of a Flea," p. 136.
   412. "Table-thing."{#61} -- "Ere the stuff grow a ring-thing right to wear." -- "The Ring and the Book," i. 17.
    "This pebble-thing, o' the boy-thing."
      -- CALVERLEY, "The Cock and the Bull."
   442. "Caird."{#62} -- See his "Hegel."
   446. "Says Huxley."{#63} -- See "Ethics and Evolution."
   459. "Igdrasil."{#64} -- The Otz Chimm of the Scandinavians.
   467. "Ladies' League."{#65) -- Mrs. J. S. Crowley says: "The Ladies' League Was Formed For The Promotion And Defence Of The Reformed Faith Of The Church Of England."  (The capitals are hers.)  I think we may accept this statement. She probably knows, and has no obvious reasons for misleading.
   487. "Sattva."{#66} -- The Buddhists, denying an Atman or Soul (an idea of changless, eternal, knowledge, being, and bliss) represent the fictitious Ego of a man (or a dog) as a temporary agglomeration of particles.  Reincarnation only knocks off, as it were, some of the corners of the mass, so that for several births the Ego is constant within limits; hence the possibility of the "magical memory."  The "Sattva" is this agglomeration.  See my {199B} "Science and Buddhism," "infra," for a full discussion of this point.
   518. "And."{#67} -- Note the correct stress upon this word.  Previously, Mr. W. S. Gilbert has done this in his superb lines:
     "Except the plot of freehold land
      That held the cot, and Mary, and --"
   But his demonstration is vitiated by the bad iambic "and Ma-"; unless indeed the juxtaposition is intentional, as exposing the sophistries of our official prosodists.
   548. "The heathen."{#68} -- "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God."
   586. "Satan and Judas." {#69} -- At the moment of passing the final proofs I am informed that the character of Judas has been rehabilitated by Mr. Stead (and rightly: is Mr. Abington<<Famous Adelphi villain.>> paid with a rope?) and the defence of Satan undertaken by a young society lady authoress -- a Miss Corelli -- who represents him as an Angel of Light, "i.e.," one who has been introduced to the Prince of Wales.
   But surely there is some one who is the object of universal reprobation amoungst Christians!  Permit me to offer myself as a candidate.  Sink, I beseech you, these sectarian differences, and combine to declare me at least Anathema Maranatha.
   602. "Pangs of Death."{#70} -- Dr. Maudsley demands a panegyric upon death. It is true that evolution may bring us a moral sense of astonishing delicacy and beauty.  But we are not there yet.  A talented but debauched Irishman has composed the following, which I can deplore, but not refute, for this type of man is probably more prone to reproduce his species than any other.  He called it "Summa Spes."

                        I.

        Existence being sorrow,
          The cause of it desire,
        A merry tune I borrow
          To light upon the lyre:
        If death destroy me quite.
          Then, I cannot lament it;
        I've lived, kept life alight,
          And -- damned if I repent it!

                Let me die in a ditch,
                  Damnably drunk
                  Or lipping a punk,
                Or in bed with a bitch!
                  I was ever a hog;
                Muck?  I am one with it!
                  Let me die like a dog;
                Die, and be done with it! {200A}

                       II.

        As far as reason goes,
          There's hope for mortals yet:
        When nothing is that knows,
          What is there to regret?
        Our consciousness depends
          On matter in the brain;
        When that rots out, and ends,
          There ends the hour of pain.

                       III.

        If we can trust to this,
          why, dance and drink and revel!
        Great scarlet mouths to kiss,
          And sorrow to the devil!
        If pangs ataxic creep,
          Or gout, or stone, annoy us,
        Queen Morphia, grant thy sleep!
          Let worms, the dears, enjoy us!

                       IV.

        But since a chance remains
          That "I" survives the body
        (So talk the men whose brains
          Are made of smut and shoddy),
        I'll stop it if I can.
          (Ah Jesus, if Thou couldest!)
        I'll go to Martaban
          To make myself a Buddhist.

                        V.

        And yet: the bigger chance
          Lies with annihilation.
        Follow the lead of France,
          Freedom's enlightened nation!
        Off! sacerdotal stealth
          Of faith and fraud and gnosis!
        Come, drink me: Here's thy health,
          Arterio-sclerosis!<<1>>

<<1. The hardening of the arteries, which is the predisposing cause of senile decay; thus taken as the one positive assurance of death.>>

                Let me die in a ditch,
                  Damnably drunk,
                  Or lipping a punk,
                Or in bed with a bitch!
                  I was ever a hog;
                Muck?  I am one with it!
                  Let me die like a dog;
                Die, and be done with it!

  616. "A lizard."{#71} -- A short account of the genesis of these poems seems not out of place here.  The design of an elaborate parody on {200B} Browning to be called "Ascension Day and Pentecost" was conceived (and resolved upon) on Friday, November 15, 1901.  On that day I left Ceylon, where I had been for several months, practising Hindu meditations, and exposing the dishonesty of the Missionaries, in the intervals of big game shooting.  The following day I wrote "Ascension Day," and "Pentecost" on the Sunday, sitting outside the dak-bangla at Madura.  These original drafts were small as compared to the present poems.
  Ascension Day consisted of: --

      p. 144, I flung ...
      p. 146, Pray do ...
      p. 147, "But who ...
      p. 149, Here's just ...
      p. 151, I will ...
      to p. 160, ... but in Hell! ...
      p. 161, You see ...
               to end.

   Pentecost consisted of: --

      p. 164, To-day ...
      p. 168, How very hard ...
      to p. 170, "Proceed!" ...
      p. 171, My wandering thoughts ...
      to p. 172, All-wickedness ...
      p. 172, Nor lull my soul ...
      to p. 174, ... and the vision.
      p. 176, How easy ...
               to end.

   "Berashith" was written at Delhi, March 20 and 21, 1902.  Its original title was "Crowleymas Day."  It was issued privately in Paris in January 1903.  It and "Science and Buddhism" are added to complete the logical sequence from 1898 till now.  All, however, has been repeatedly revised.  Wherever there seemed a lacuna in the argument an insertion was made, till all appeared a perfect chrysolite.  Most of this was done, while the weary hours of the summer (save the mark!) of 1902 rolled over Camp Misery and Camp Despair on the Chogo Ri Glacier, in those rare intervals when one's preoccupation with lice, tinned food, malaria, insoaking water, general soreness, mental misery, and the everlasting snowstorm gave place to a momentary glimmer of any higher form of intelligence than that ever necessarily concentrated on the actual business of camp life.  The rest, and the final revision, occupied a good deal of my time during the winter of 1902-1903.  The MS. was accepted by the S. P. R. T. in May of this year, and after a post-final revision, rendered necessary by my Irish descent, went to press.
